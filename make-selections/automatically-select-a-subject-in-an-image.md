# Automatically select a subject in an image

To make a selection that includes only the main subject in an image, you can use the smart Select Subject tool. An AI-powered object detection algorithm will automatically locate and select the subject in a layer or layer group for you.

Do any of the following:

* Click the Select Subject button in the toolbar. If it's not visible by default, you can add it from the Customize Toolbar menu. Choose **Window > Customize Toolbar** to open it, then drag the Select Subject item to the toolbar.
* Choose **Edit > Select Subject** from the Edit menu at the top of your screen
* Press `Control ⌃` + `S` on your keyboard.
* With any of the selection tools selected, click Select Subject in the Tool Options pane.

To select a subject while taking into account all document layers, not just the active layer, press and hold `Option ⌥` when clicking Select Subject in the Tool Options pane.

:blue\_book: **Note:** If you'd like to additionally add or remove parts of the selection after you've used Select Subject, choose any of the [selection tools](./) in Pixelmator Pro to find Add, Subtract, and Intersect selection modes in the Tool Options pane.
