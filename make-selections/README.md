# Make selections

Selections are used in image editing when you want to focus all your edits on specific areas of an image without altering any of the areas around it. An active selection is represented by a moving, dashed line, sometimes also called the _marching ants_.&#x20;

Once a selection has been created, any painting, color adjustments, or effects you apply to an image will only have an effect inside the selection. To work outside the boundaries of a selection, you can invert the selection or deselect it completely.

Pixelmator Pro has 9 different selection tools, all offering different methods for selecting areas of an image.
