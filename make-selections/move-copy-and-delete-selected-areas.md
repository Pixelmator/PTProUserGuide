# Move, copy, and delete selected areas

Once you have made a selection, you can move, copy, delete, or cut the selected areas, apply effects or adjustments to them, create masks, crop images, and more.

## Move a selected area

1. Choose the Arrange tool by doing one of the following:
   * Click the Arrange <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580998658000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Tools > Arrange** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `V` key on your keyboard.
2. Move the pointer inside the selection and drag the selected area to a new position.

## Copy or cut and paste a selected area

1. Make a selection of the area you want to copy.
2. To copy the area, choose **Edit > Copy** or **Edit > Cut**.
3. To paste the area, choose **Edit > Paste**. 

You can cut, copy, and paste from Pixelmator Pro into other apps, or from other apps into Pixelmator Pro.

&#x20;:bulb: **Tip:** If, after pasting a selection, you notice any trace of the previous background color you want to remove, you can use the [Decontaminate Colors](../automatically-edit-images/decontaminate-colors.md) feature. Choose **Format > Image > Decontaminate Colors** to apply it.&#x20;

## Copy or cut and paste a selected area as a new layer

1. Make a selection of the area you want to copy.
2. With any selection tool active, `Control ⌃` – click the image and choose Copy and Paste as Layer or Cut and Paste as Layer.

You can also press the `Command ⌘` + `J` and `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `J` keyboard shortcuts to copy or cut and paste selections as new layers.
