# Select the entire image

To quickly make a selection that includes the entire canvas, you can use a keyboard shortcut or a dedicated option in the top menu, without having to work with individual selection tools.

Do one of the following:

* Choose **Edit > Select All**.
* Press `Command âŒ˜` + `A` on your keyboard.

:blue\_book:**Note:** Although the entire image is selected, the Pixelmator Pro tools and features will only affect the layer selected in the Layers sidebar, rather than all the layers included in the selection.
