# Convert selections into shapes

You can convert selections into shapes and continue working on them as you would with regular shapes — edit vector paths, combine them with other shapes, or save them to the Shapes palette.&#x20;

1. Make a selection using any of the selection tools.
2. Do one of the following:
   * Choose **Format > Convert into Shape** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
   * `Control ⌃` – click inside the selection and choose Convert into Shape.

:blue\_book: **Note:** When converting selections into shapes, Pixelmator Pro will apply your last-used styles to them. If you'd like to change how the shape looks after you add it, you can do so using the [Style tool](../customize-layers-using-styles/).
