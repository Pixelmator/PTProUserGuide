# Quickly export or share an optimized image

The Quick Export feature lets you export your entire image optimized with the settings of any of your [export presets](export-presets.md). You can also send a copy of the image via AirDrop, Mail, Messages, or add it to other apps such as the macOS Photos app, Reminders, Notes, and more.

1. Click Share <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580744717000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Pixelmator Pro toolbar.
2.  Choose one of the Quick Export options.

    :blue\_book: **Note:** Sharing an image to Photos (Add to Photos) creates a new image in your library. If you've opened the image directly from the Photos app (using **Edit With > Pixelmator Pro**) and would like to overwrite it, choose **File > Save** instead.
3. If prompted, choose a location to save the exported images or videos.
4. Click Export.

To add your own Quick Export options, create a new [export preset](export-presets.md) or redefine an existing one.
