Create an image from the clipboard

The new image will be created using the image you have saved to the clipboard. The clipboard is a macOS feature that contains the last thing you copied on your Mac — if it’s an image, the clipboard option will appear in the template browser. If it's text or something else, that option will not be shown.

1. On your Mac, iPhone, or iPad, copy an image to Clipboard.
2. Open Pixelmator Pro by clicking the Pixelmator Pro icon in the Dock, Launchpad, or the Applications folder.
3. Do one of the following:
   * In the Pixelmator Pro Welcome screen, click Create a new document. If the Welcome screen doesn't show up, choose **Window > Welcome to Pixelmator Pro** (from the Window menu at the top of the screen.)
   * Choose **File > New** (from the File menu at the top of your screen).
   * Control ⌃ – click the Pixelmator Pro icon in the Dock and choose New From Clipboard. ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1650547869000.jpeg)

5. Click Create or press the Return ↵ key.

And, with [Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-lamr/102430), you can even copy media on one Apple device and create a new document in Pixelmator Pro on another.
