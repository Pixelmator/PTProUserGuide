# Edit brush settings

Each brush in Pixelmator Pro has a range of settings that can be modified to change the way the brush paints. The settings for the Paint tool let you quickly adjust the size, softness, opacity, blend mode, and color. Additional specifications like the brush grain spacing, shape direction, and others can be found in the Advanced Settings menu.

## Edit shape settings of a brush

1. After choosing a brush to edit, under the Advanced Settings, click the brush settings pop-up menu and choose Shape.
2. Customize the following brush settings:
   *   _Shape Direction:_ Move the Shape Direction slider to adjust how closely the brush shape texture should follow your painting direction.&#x20;

       At -100%, the angle of a brushstroke’s each internal brush mark is fixed. At 100%, the brush marks are rotated to follow your painting direction completely.
   * _Scale Shape Horizontally:_ Move this slider to adjust the horizontal size of the brush shape.
   * _Scale Shape Vertically:_ Move this slider to adjust the vertical size of the brush shape.
   *   _Initial Direction:_ Choose an initial direction for the brush shape:

       Fixed — The brushstroke’s first brush mark is fixed at its original position.&#x20;

       Random — The brushstroke’s first brush mark is placed at a random angle.

       Directed — The brushstroke’s first brush mark follows your initial painting direction.

:blue\_book:**Note:** These settings combine with the Shape Direction setting. For example, with Random as the Initial Direction and the Shape Direction setting at 0%, the first brush mark is placed at a random angle and every subsequent brush mark is placed at that same angle. With Random as the Initial Direction and the Shape Direction setting at 100%, the first brush mark is placed at a random angle and every subsequent brush mark is rotated according to your painting direction relative to the original (random) angle.&#x20;
