# Create a brush

Pixelmator Pro brushes are composed of two images (or textures) — a shape and a grain. When you paint, the shape and the grain are repeatedly stamped onto your image to create continuous brushstrokes. You can think of the shape as the outline of a brush and the grain as its internal texture (although the shape also contributes to the texture of a brushstroke).

To create a custom brush, you’ll need images of the shape and, optionally, the grain. When creating an image for the brush, any white areas will be 100% transparent and any black areas will be 100% opaque. So a black circle on a white background would create a regular round brush.

Once you have a shape, you'll need to duplicate an existing brush to create a new one. If you're aiming for a look similar to that of an existing brush, it might be best to duplicate that specific brush and start by replacing its existing shape texture.

## Duplicate a brush

1. Choose the Paint tool by doing one of the following:&#x20;
   * Click the Paint <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Paint.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar or choose it from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Paint** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `B` key on your keyboard.
2. At the top of the Tool Options pane, click the name of the brush to open the Brushes Browser and select a brush.
3. `Control ⌃` – click a brush and choose Duplicate from the menu that appears.

After duplicating your brush, you'll need to replace the brush shape and texture.

## Add a custom shape texture or grain to a brush

1. Under Advanced Settings, choose the General category from the Brush settings pop-up menu.
2. Click the Shape pop-up menu below the shape texture preview and choose Import. If you want to change the grain of the brush, click the Grain pop-up menu.
3. Find your shape texture or grain and click Import.&#x20;

Alternatively, you can simply drag in a new texture directly from your desktop, Finder, or other locations.

Once you change the brush texture or grain, feel free to [edit the settings of the brush](edit-brush-settings.md) and make it paint just the way you want.
