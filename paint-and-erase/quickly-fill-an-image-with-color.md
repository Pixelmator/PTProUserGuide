# Quickly fill an image with color

Quickly fill images, selections, or individual objects with a solid color. You can choose to fill with foreground or background color specifically. See [Choosing colors](../pixelmator-pro-basics/choose-and-manage-colors-in-pixelmator-pro.md) to learn more about choosing foreground or background colors.

### Fill with the Quick Fill tool

1. Use the color picker to [choose the color](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1231) you want.
2. Choose **Format > Image > Image Fill with Color** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
3.  Customize Quick Fill options:

    1. _Color:_ Click the color well in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary) to choose or change the fill color.
    2. _Blend Mode:_ Click the Blend Mode pop-up menu to choose how the fill color blends with the colors of the layer below.
    3. _Opacity:_ Drag the Opacity slider to adjust the transparency of the fill.
    4. _Sample All Layers:_ Select Sample All Layers to take into account the contents of every layer in your image when filling, not just the selected layer.
    5. _Smooth Edges:_ Select Smooth Edges to naturally smooth the outline of the fill. With Smooth Edges unselected, the outline will be a little more precise but jagged.
    6. _Preserve Transparency:_ Select Preserve Transparency to fill only the opaque areas of an image, leaving the transparent areas untouched or deselect it to disregard transparency in an image.

### Fill with foreground or background color

* Press `Option ⌥` + `Backspace ⌫` to fill with a foreground color.
* Press `Command ⌘` + `Backspace ⌫` to fill with a background color.

When using quick fill shortcuts, you can also press and hold the `Shift ⇧` key to fill only the opaque areas of a layer.

&#x20;**Tip:** To quickly fill an image, text, or shape, you can also drag a color from the color well in the toolbar or any color well in Pixelmator Pro directly onto a layer.
