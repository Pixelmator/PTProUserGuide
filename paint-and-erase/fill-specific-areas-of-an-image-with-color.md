# Fill specific areas of an image with color

The Color Fill tool fills in similarly colored areas of an image with your chosen solid color.

***

### Fill with the Color Fill tool

1. Choose the Color Fill tool by doing one of the following:&#x20;
   * Click Color Fill <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580999220000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar or choose it from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Color Fill** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `N` key on your keyboard.
2. Customize the Color Fill tool:
   * _Color:_ Click the color well to choose a color or click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1588174408000.png" alt="" data-size="line">to pick a color from the image.
   * _Blend Mode:_ Click the Blend Mode pop-up menu to choose a blend mode.
   * _Opacity:_ Drag the Opacity slider to adjust the transparency of the Color Fill tool.
   * _Sample All Layers:_ Select Sample All Layers to make the Color Fill take into account the contents of every layer in your image, not just the selected layer.
   * _Smooth Edges:_ Select Smooth Edges to naturally smooth the outline of the Color Fill tool. With Smooth Edges unselected, the outline will be a little more precise but jagged.
   *   _Preserve Transparency:_ Select Preserve Transparency to only fill the opaque areas of an image, leaving the transparent areas untouched, or deselect it to disregard transparency in an image.

3.  Drag on the canvas to fill in similarly colored areas.

    The more you drag, the larger the area Color Fill tool will fill. If youâ€™d like to fill the entire layer regardless of any existing colors in it, drag until the Tolerance value reaches 100%.
