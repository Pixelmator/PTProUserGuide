# Fill with the Gradient Fill tool

The Gradient Fill tool fills layers with your chosen gradient â€” a gradual transition between multiple colors. You can choose from the gradient presets that come with Pixelmator Pro or create and save your own. You can also fill any layer with a gradient using the Gradient Fill effect.

A gradient will always have at least two colors. Each color is represented by color stops on a fill bar. You can change how the gradient looks by adding or removing stops, adjusting their position, and setting the color and transparency of each.

1. Choose the Gradient Fill tool by doing one of the following:&#x20;
   * Click Gradient <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Gradient-Fill.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar or choose it from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Gradient Fill** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `G` key on your keyboard.
2.  Click the presets well to choose from the available presets or customize any selected gradient:

    * _Change colors:_ Click any of the existing color stops to open the Colors window and choose a new color.
    * _Add additional colors:_ Click below the gradient bar to add a new color stop.
    * _Remove colors_: To remove a color stop, drag it away from the gradient fill bar.
    * _Reverse colors_: Click Reverse to reverse the gradient colors.
    * _Choose a gradient type_: \
      &#xNAN;_&#x4C;inear gradient:_ Blends colors between color stops, all along a line.\
      &#xNAN;_&#x52;adial gradient_: Blends from start to end in a circular pattern.\
      &#xNAN;_&#x41;ngle gradient_: Blends colors in a sweep.
