# Paint and erase

Pixelmator Pro includes a number of different painting tools that you can use to create digital or traditional paintings, draw, sketch, illustrate, paint on your photos, and more. There are a number of different brushes for you to paint with — some of these brushes emulate traditional drawing and painting tools while others are digital brushes. These brushes are fully customizable and you can even [create your own brushes from scratch](create-a-brush.md).

Along with the Paint tool, the other painting tools are the Quick Fill, Color Fill, and Gradient Fill tools, the Pixel tool, the Erase, and the Smart Erase tools.

   :exclamation:**Important:** The Erase tool erases areas to transparency, i.e. any areas you erase become see-through. If you’d like to erase an area to make it white, you should paint with the Paint tool using the color white. Alternatively, you can add an empty layer underneath all your other layers and fill it with white.
