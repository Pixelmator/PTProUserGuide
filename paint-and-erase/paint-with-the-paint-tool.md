# Paint with the Paint tool

Pixelmator Pro includes a number of different painting tools that you can use to create digital or traditional paintings, draw, sketch, illustrate, paint on your photos, and more. There's a number of different brushes for you to paint with — some of these brushes emulate traditional drawing and painting tools while others are digital brushes. These brushes are fully customizable and you can even create your own brushes from scratch.

Along with the Paint tool, the other painting tools are the Quick Fill, Color Fill and Gradient Fill tools, the Pixel tool, the Erase, and the Smart Erase tools.

    * _Brush Size:_ Drag the Brush Size slider to adjust the size of the Paint tool brush. Press and hold the `Option ⌥` key to extend the range of the Brush Size slider beyond 500 pixels. You can also manually enter a value from 1 px to 5000 px.
    * _Softness:_ Drag the Softness slider to adjust the softness of the edges of the Paint tool brush.
    * _Blend Mode:_ Click the Blend Mode pop-up menu to choose a blend mode.

    *   _Smoothing:_ Smoothing automatically smooths out brush strokes as you paint allowing for straighter, more stable lines. You can turn on Smoothing at the bottom of the Paint tool options pane and choose the strength of smoothing from the pop-up menu, 10% giving you minimal smoothing and 100% — maximum smoothing.
