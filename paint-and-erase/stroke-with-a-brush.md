# Stroke with a brush

Using the Stroke with Brush feature, you can automatically convert the outline of any image layer, path, shape or selection into a brush stroke. Once you apply the stroke, you'll see its live preview and how it changes as you switch between different brushes or make adjustments to the specific brush settings.

### Apply the brush stroke

1. Select the layer you want to stroke
2. Do one of the following:
   1. Choose the Paint tool <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580999191000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and click Stroke with Brush at the bottom of the tool options pane.
   2. Choose **Format > Stroke with Brush** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
   3. Press `Option ⌥` + `Command ⌘` + `B` on your keyboard.

### Customize the brush stroke

You can customize the brush stroke using the basic or advanced brush settings, just like you would with a regular brush. See Edit a brush to learn more.

Note that some of the stylus-related settings, like the ones in the Stroke or Dynamics categories, cannot be edited.

_Simulate Pressure:_ You can use Simulate Pressure to take into account the brush pressure settings. The Max Pressure Location slider lets you set the location where brush stroke is the thickest or thinnest as if drawing with a graphics tablet.
