# Erase using the Erase tool

The Erase tool lets you erase image areas using any brush in your collection.

***

### Erase using the Erase tool

1. Choose the Erase tool by doing one of the following:&#x20;
   * Click Erase <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580999243000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar or choose it from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Erase** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `E` key on your keyboard.
2. In the Tool Options pane, click the Brushes Browser to select an eraser brush.&#x20;
3. Customize the Erase tool:
   1. _Brush Size:_ Drag the Brush Size slider to adjust the size of the Erase tool brush. You can also enter a value from 1 to 5000 px.
   2. _Softness:_ Drag the Softness slider to adjust the softness of the edges of the Erase tool brush.
   3. _Opacity:_ Drag the Opacity slider to adjust the transparency of the Erase tool.
   4.  _Smoothing:_ Smoothing automatically smooths out brush strokes as you paint allowing for straighter, more stable lines. You can turn on Smoothing at the bottom of the Erase tool options and choose the strength of smoothing from the pop-up menu, 10% giving you minimal smoothing and 100% — maximum smoothing.

       In the Brushes Browser, you can choose a brush from the collections on the left or search for brushes by name using the search field at the top. See [Paint with the Paint tool](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1038) to learn more about creating, deleting, renaming brush collections, and more using the Brushes Browser.\


       :bulb: **Tip:** You can `Control ⌃` – click the canvas to bring up a shortcut menu with Brush Size and Softness slider to adjust the settings of your brush more quickly. You can also use the `[` and `]` keys on your keyboard to change the size of the Erase tool brush.\

4. Drag on the canvas to erase. You can temporarily switch from painting to erasing by pressing and holding `` ` `` or `~` on your keyboard.

:exclamation:**Important:** The Erase tool erases areas to transparency, i.e. any areas you erase become see-through. If you’d like to erase an area to make it white, you should paint with the [Paint tool](paint-with-the-paint-tool.md) using the color white. Alternatively, you can add an empty layer underneath all your other layers and fill it with white.
