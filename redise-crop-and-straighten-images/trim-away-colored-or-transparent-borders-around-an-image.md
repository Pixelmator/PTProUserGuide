# Trim away colored or transparent borders around an image

The Trim Canvas command removes any transparent or solid colored areas at the edges of an image and hides them beyond the edges of the canvas.

1. Choose **Image > Trim Canvas** from the Image menu at the top of your screen, or click More <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1605162881000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Pixelmator Pro toolbar and choose Trim Canvas.
2.  Choose one of the following options:

    * _Transparent Pixels_: Trims away transparent areas at the edges of the image.
    * _Top Left Pixel Color_: Trims away areas from the image of the same color as the upper left pixel.
    * _Bottom Right Pixel Color_: Trims away areas from the image of the same color as the lower right pixel.
