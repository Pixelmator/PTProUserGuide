# Quickly export or share an optimized image

The Quick Export feature lets you export your entire image optimized with the settings of any of your [export presets](broken-reference). You can also send a copy of the image via AirDrop, Mail, Messages, or add it to other apps such as the macOS Photos app, Reminders, Notes, and more.

### Quickly export an image or video

1. Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580744717000.png) in the Pixelmator Pro [toolbar](https://about/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).
2.  Choose one of the Quick Export options.

    _Note:_ Sharing an image to Photos (Add to Photos) creates a new image in your library. If you've opened the image directly from the Photos app (using **Edit With > Pixelmator Pro**) and would like to overwrite it, choose **File > Save** instead.
3. If prompted, choose a location to save the exported images or videos.
4. Click Export.
