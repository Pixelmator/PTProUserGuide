# Working with layer styles

When working with layer styles, there are a couple of useful things to know that will let you maximize your results. For example, you can rearrange the order in which styles are applied, temporarily disable specific styles, or even reset all the styles applied to a particular layer.

## Turn styles on or off

When a layer style is turned off, it no longer shows on the layer but is still visible in the Tool Options pane. Turning the layer style back on restores all of its previous settings.

1. Choose the Style tool by doing one of the following:
   * Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1576511015000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Tools > Style** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `S` key on your keyboard.
2. Select the layer or layers you would like to edit.
3. Turn the switch next to Fill, Stroke, Shadow, or Drop Shadow styles on or off. If a style you want to add is not visible, click Add Style at the top of the tool options pane.

## Remove a style

When you remove a layer style, it no longer shows on the layer and is no longer visible in the Tool Options pane.

1. Choose the Style tool by doing one of the following:
   * Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1576511015000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Tools > Style** (from the Tools menu at the top of your screen).
   * Press the `S` key on your keyboard.
2. Select the layer or layers you would like to edit.
3. Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1604317638000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> next to the style you want to remove.

## Copy a layer style from one layer to another

A quick way to apply the same layer style to multiple layers is by using [layer style presets](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/916). However, you can also apply the same layer style to multiple layers by simply copying it over.

1. Select the layer with the style you’d like to copy.
2. To copy the style, do one of the following:
   * Choose **Format > Styles > Copy Styles** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
   * In the Layers sidebar, `Control ⌃` – click the layer from which you’d like to copy a style and choose **Styles > Copy Styles**.
3. Select the layer to which you’d like to apply the copied style.
4. To paste the style, do one of the following:
   * Choose **Format > Styles > Paste Styles** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
   * In the Layers sidebar, `Control ⌃` – click the layer to which you’d like to paste the style and choose **Styles > Paste Styles**.

## Rearrange the order of layer styles

If you apply two or more of the same layer styles to a single layer, you can rearrange the order in which they are applied.

To rearrange layer styles, click and drag a style up or down the list of styles.

## Flatten layer styles

Flattening (or merging) all the styles applied to a layer can be useful when you want to make edits to the layer together with the layer style. For example, you might want to erase part of a layer as well as the shadow applied to it. Without flattening, the shadow would adapt to the new shape of the layer.

1. Choose the Style tool by doing one of the following:
   * Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1576511015000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Tools > Style** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `S` key on your keyboard.
2. Select the layer or layers you would like to edit.
3. Press and hold the `Option ⌥` key and, in the Tool Options pane, click the Flatten Styles button at the bottom.

You can also choose **Format > Styles > Flatten Styles** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen), or in the Layers sidebar, `Control ⌃` – click the layer you’d like to flatten and choose **Styles > Flatten Styles**.
