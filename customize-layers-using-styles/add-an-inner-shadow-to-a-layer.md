# Add an inner shadow to a layer

The Inner Shadow layer style adds a drop shadow inside your selected layer, giving it a recessed or hollowed-out appearance.

## Add an inner shadow style

1. [Select the layer or layers](../work-with-layers/select-layers.md) you would like to edit.
2. Choose the Style tool by doing one of the following:
   * Click the Style <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Style.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Tools > Style** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `S` key on your keyboard.
3. In the Tool Options pane, click Add Style and choose Inner Shadow. You can add as many of the same styles as you like.

## Customize the Inner Shadow layer style

* _Blur:_ Move the Blur slider to adjust how much to soften the edges of the shadow. You can also enter a value from 0 px to 100 px.
* _Distance:_ Move the Distance slider to adjust how far the shadow is from the object. Press and hold the `Option ⌥` key to extend the range of the Distance slider. You can also enter a value from 0 px to 400 px.
* _Angle:_ Move the Angle wheel to change the angle of the shadow. You can also enter a value between 0º and 359.9º.
* _Color:_ Click the color well to choose a color or click the eyedropper<img src="../.gitbook/assets/Color-picker.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to pick a color from the image.

If you have applied multiple Inner Shadow layer styles to a single layer and you’d like to [rearrange](./#rearrange-the-order-of-layer-styles) them, simply drag the style up or down the list of styles.

To reset all styles applied to an image, click Reset Style at the bottom of the Tool Options pane.
