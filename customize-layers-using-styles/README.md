# Customize layers using styles

The Style tool is used to customize the look of layers by changing their transparency, customizing how they blend with other layers in your composition, and adding fills, strokes, shadows, and inner shadows. Layer styles can be applied to any layer in a composition, whether itâ€™s an image, shape, or text layer. You can also copy a style applied to one layer and apply it to others.
