# Open an image

You can open images in a variety of different image formats saved on your Mac, in [iCloud Drive](https://about/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), on connected servers, and third-party storage providers. The following file formats are supported in Pixelmator Pro: PXD, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, HEIC, PSD, SVG, PDF, GIF, BMP, TGA, WebP, JPEG-2000, macOS-supported RAW formats.

When you open an image in one of the above formats, it is automatically converted to PXD — the [Pixelmator Pro file format](.gitbook/assets/639) — so when you save the image, any additional layers and advanced formatting you add are not lost and remain editable. Once you finish editing and would like to share an image with someone else or upload it online, you can save it as a JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, or HEIC image or [export](.gitbook/assets/798) it.

Alternatively, instead of importing images as PXD documents, you can choose to open them in their original file format — JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WebP, or HEIC — and save changes directly back to the same file format using sidecar files. This workflow lets you share the edited images directly, without having to export them first. You can learn more about different editing workflows in Pixelmator Pro and change how it opens images in the article about Editing settings.

**Tip:** You can also open images by simply dragging them from a website on Safari or a folder in Finder onto the Pixelmator Pro icon in the Dock.



If a photo you add happens to be larger than the canvas, some of its content may be hidden beyond the edges of the canvas. [Zoom out](pixelmator-pro-basics/zoom-in-and-out-of-an-image.md) of the image until you see the layer handles, then resize it to fit the canvas.

## Opening vector and bitmap PDFs

In Pixelmator Pro, you can choose to open PDF documents as bitmaps (an image-based type of PDF), or vector PDFs (PDFs that support layers). Vector PDFs let you edit shape and image elements in PDFs as separate layers and scale documents to any size without losing quality. Bitmap PDFs open with all their contents merged into a single page which also has a fixed resolution. Because of this, bitmap PDFs have more limited options for editing and may lose quality when upscaling.

When opening multi-page PDFs in Pixelmator Pro, you can also choose which page you'd like to open and edit.

1. Open a PDF document in Pixelmator Pro.
2. In the PDF open dialog, choose how to open the PDF document:
   * For multi-page PDFs, browse the list of pages on the left to select the one you wish to open.
   * Adjust the Width and Height of the PDF document and set the desired resolution.
   * To open the document as a vector PDF with layers, make sure "Import PDF with layers" is selected. Deselect this option if you want to import a flattened, bitmap PDF.
3. Click Import.
