# Warp a specific area of an image

The Warp tool lets you push and pull a specific area of an image in any direction. You can use Warp to subtly fix certain imperfections or completely distort images, creating a melted or liquified look.

1. Do one of the following:
   * In the Tools sidebar, click Smudge <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Wrap.png" alt="" data-size="line"> or choose if from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Reshape > Warp** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
2. In the Tool Options pane, customize the Warp tool:
   * _Brush Size:_ Drag the Brush Size slider to adjust the size of the Warp tool brush. Press and hold the `Option ⌥` key to extend the range of the Brush Size slider beyond 100%. You can also manually enter a value from 0% to 200%. 
   *   _Strength:_ Drag the Strength slider to adjust the intensity of the warping effect.

       &#x20;:bulb: **Tip:** You can use the `[` and `]` keys on your keyboard to change the size of the Warp tool brush.  
3. Click and drag an area of your image to warp it.
