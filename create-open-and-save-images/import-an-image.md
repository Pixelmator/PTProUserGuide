# Import an image

You can import images from scanners, cameras, and other devices to edit them with Pixelmator Pro. The Import browser shows USB and network devices, displays their names, types, and icons. The list is updated dynamically as devices are plugged in, removed, or renamed.

## Import an image

You can import images from cameras, iPhone and iPads, memory card readers, USB drives, etc.

1. Choose **File > Import** (from the File menu at the top of your screen).
2. Select the device from which you want to import images.
3. Locate and select the images you want to import.
4. Click Import or Import All.

## Import an image from a scanner

You can scan images or documents in Pixelmator Pro using a document-feeding or a flatbed scanner.

1. Prepare the pages.
   * _Document-feeding scanner:_ Place the pages in the scanner’s document feeder. You can scan several pages at once. The same settings are used for all the pages in the feeder. If pages need different settings (for example, some are grayscale and some are color), scan them in different groups.
   * _Flatbed scanner:_ Place the items on the scanner bed. You can scan several smaller images at once, save each image in its own file, and straighten any images that were crooked on the bed during scanning.
2.  In Pixelmator Pro, choose **File > Import** and choose your scanner.

    You see the Import dialog showing the overview scan being prepared. If you don’t see your scanner in the list, make sure it’s set up in Printers & Scanners settings on your Mac.
3. Set scanning options. You may need to click Show Details to see all the available options. You can choose any of the following:
   * _Scan Mode:_ Choose Flatbed or Document Feeder from the pop-up menu.
   * _Kind:_ Choose a document type. Choose Text for black-and-white images with high contrast, such as a text document; choose Black & White for grayscale images; and choose Color for color images.
   * _Orientation:_ Select Duplex to scan both sides of a page.
   * _Size:_ Choose a size for the scanned item.
   * _Image Correction:_ Adjust the color or exposure of the scanned image. Choose Manual, then adjust the controls.
   * _Scan To:_ Choose where to save the scanned items. If you don’t see this option, you can choose a location to save your scans later, once scanning is complete and your scan opens in Pixelmator Pro. If you don’t see the image correction controls, scroll down or make the Scanner window taller.
4.  Click Scan.

    The scanner scans the pages one at a time.
