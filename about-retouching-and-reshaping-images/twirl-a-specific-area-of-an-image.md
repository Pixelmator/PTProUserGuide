# Twirl a specific area of an image

When you click or drag an area in your image with the Twirl tool, it rotates the areas inside the brush around in a circle, creating a twirl. You can use Twirl to add a wavy look to an image, create twirls, or other artistic effects.

1. Do one of the following:
   * In the Tools sidebar, click Twirl <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Twirl.png" alt="" data-size="line"> or choose if from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Reshape > Twirl** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
2. In the Tool Options pane, customize the Twirl tool:
   1. _Brush Size:_ Drag the Brush Size slider to adjust the size of the Twirl tool brush. Press and hold the `Option ⌥` key to extend the range of the Brush Size slider beyond 100%. You can also manually enter a value from 0% to 200%. 
   2. _Strength:_ Drag the Strength slider to adjust the intensity of the twirling effect. 
   3. _Twirl Right:_ Click to twirl the area clockwise.
   4.  _Twirl Left:_ Click to twirl the area counterclockwise.

       :bulb: **Tip:** You can use the `[` and `]` keys on your keyboard to change the size of the Twirl tool brush.
3. Click and hold or drag an area of your image to twirl it.
