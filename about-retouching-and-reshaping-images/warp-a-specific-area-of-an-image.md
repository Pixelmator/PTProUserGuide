# Warp a specific area of an image

The Warp tool lets you push and pull a specific area of an image in any direction. You can use Warp to subtly fix certain imperfections or completely distort images, creating a melted or liquified look.

   * Choose **Tools > Reshape > Warp** (from the Tools menu at the top of your screen).
