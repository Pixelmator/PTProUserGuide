# Bump a specific area of an image

When you click or drag an area in your image with the Bump tool, it moves the central areas away toward the edges of the brush, creating a bump in that part of your image. You can use Bump to make certain elements in an image larger and more prominent.

***

1. Do one of the following:
   * Choose **Tools > Reshape > Bump** (from the Tools menu at the top of your screen).
   * In the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580999656000.png) or choose if from the [grouped tools](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).
2.  In the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), customize the Bump tool:

    _Brush Size:_ Drag the Brush Size slider to adjust the size of the Bump tool brush. Press and hold the Option ⌥ key to extend the range of the Brush Size slider beyond 100%. You can also manually enter a value from 0% to 200%. 

    _Strength:_ Drag the Strength slider to adjust the intensity of the bulging effect. 

    &#x20;**Tip:** You can use the \[ and ] keys on your keyboard to change the size of the Bump tool brush.
3. Click and hold or drag an area of your image to bump it.
