# Remove an object from an image

Use the Repair tool to remove anything from small imperfections, like specks of dust or blemishes, to entire objects from an image. The Repair tool is brush-based, so you brush over an object to remove it. When you paint over an area with the Repair tool, it takes parts of the surrounding areas and intelligently stitches them together, matching the colors, textures, lighting, to seamlessly recreate the area of the image left behind after removing an object.

Remove an object from an image using the Repair tool

1. Do one of the following:
   * Choose **Tools > Retouch > Repair** (from the Tools menu at the top of your screen).
   * In the Tools sidebar, click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580999369000.png" alt="" data-size="line">.
   * Press R on your keyboard.
2.  In the Tool Options pane, customize the Repair tool:

    _Brush Size:_ Drag the Brush Size slider to adjust the size of the Repair tool brush.

    _Sample All Layers:_ Select Sample All Layers to repair areas using every layer in your image. This option is useful when you want to repair an area nondestructively. In that case, you’d need to add a new, empty layer, select Sample All Layers and paint on the empty layer. Another use is when you have several images on separate layers and you’d like to repair the image as if it was one layer.
3. Paint over the object in your image you’d like to remove.
