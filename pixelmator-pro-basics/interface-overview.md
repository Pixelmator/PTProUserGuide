# Interface overview

Pixelmator Pro features a single-window, easy-to-use interface, designed for editing images and creating graphic designs. The main parts of the interface are the image canvas in the center, the Tools sidebar on the right, the Layers sidebar on the left, and the toolbar at the top. You can also customize the default layout of Pixelmator Pro to arrange the interface elements differently. See [Change the Pixelmator Pro layout](pixelmator-pro-settings/workspace-settings.md) to learn more.

There are also additional elements such as overlays or rulers that are hidden by default. You can choose to view them if you need them from the View menu at the top of your screen.

## Tools sidebar

The Tools sidebar contains the tools you need to create graphic designs, draw, or enhance the look of images. The default set of Pixelmator Pro tools is conveniently arranged based on their function. You can find groups of tools for making selections, painting and erasing, retouching, and more.

You can also [customize the Tools sidebar ](customize-the-tools-sidebar.md)to create a toolset for your specific editing style.

<div align="left">

<img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1652093242000.png" alt="" height="645.5" width="694">

</div>

Some tools in the Tools sidebar are grouped with one or a few other tools. To select a different tool from a group, click the grouped tool twice, force click, or `Control ⌃` – click it. For more information about the different tools and their functions, see [Pixelmator Pro tools](pixelmator-pro-tools.md).

#### Show or hide the Tools sidebar

Do one of the following:

* Choose **View > Show (or Hide) Tools** from the View menu at the top of your screen.
* Click Hide or Show the Tools sidebar <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Sidebar.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the toolbar.
* Press `Option ⌥` + `T` on your keyboard.

To temporarily show or hide the tool names (in vertical sidebar mode), press `Control ⌃` + `O` on your keyboard.

## Tool Options pane

The Tool Options pane is where you customize the Pixelmator Pro tools, effects, and manage presets. If you're using Pixelmator Pro for the first time, the Tool Options pane will automatically appear once you select a tool from the Tools sidebar. The options in the Tool Options pane change when you select different tools. Below you can see a few examples of the various Tool Options views:

## Layers sidebar

The Layers sidebar is one of the most essential parts of the Pixelmator Pro workspace. The Layers sidebar lets you view and select the different levels of a project you're working on, add new layers, manage layer visibility, and lots more.

<div align="right">

<img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648711912000.png" alt="">

</div>

#### Layers list

In the layers list, you can see a visual layout of your entire project — each thumbnail represents a separate element in your composition or, in other words, a _layer_. You can give layers unique names, change the size of the layer thumbnails, or choose to list thumbnails along with certain layer properties. It’s also possible to hide the Layers sidebar completely if you're not using layers in your project.

At the top of the Layers sidebar, click More <img src="../.gitbook/assets/More.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and customize the Viewing Options for the layers list:

* _Size._ Choose between three different thumbnail sizes: small, medium, and large.
* _Show layer descriptions._ Select this option to see additional layer properties when editing, such as layer size, type, or edits applied.
* _Blending position._ Select Top to pin the blend modes and opacity to the top of the Layers sidebar or Bottom, to pin them to the bottom.

See [Work with layers](../working-with-layers/) to learn more about working with layers.

#### Layer opacity

You can adjust how transparent or opaque the layers should be using the Opacity setting. Drag the Opacity slider or click the percentage field to enter a custom value.

See [Adjust the opacity of a layer](../customize-layers-using-styles/adjust-the-opacity-of-a-layer.md) to learn more about adjusting layer opacity.

{% embed url="https://d2hh90bli6ucxp.cloudfront.net/help/layers/opacity-2.4.mp4" %}

#### Layer blending

Blend modes let you change the look of layers by mixing and combining layer colors. Select a layer, choose a blend mode, and the colors of the selected layer will blend with the layers underneath it. Using different blend modes, you can achieve some unique-looking artistic effects, improve image retouching workflows, and more.

See [Change the blend mode of a layer](../customize-layers-using-styles/change-the-blend-mode-of-a-layer.md) to learn more about layer blending.

{% embed url="https://d2hh90bli6ucxp.cloudfront.net/help/basics/blend-modes-2.4.mp4" %}

#### Search and filter layers

You can search your document for specific layers by typing their name into the search field at the bottom of the Layers sidebar. The filter search can also help sort layers based on their type (images, shapes, text, RAW images, groups, masks, color adjustments, effects, videos) or tags.

See [Work with layers](../working-with-layers/) to learn more about managing layers.

{% embed url="https://d2hh90bli6ucxp.cloudfront.net/help/basics/layer-search-2.4.mp4" %}

#### Show or hide the Layers sidebar

Do one of the following:

* Click Show or Hide the Layers sidebar <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Panel.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the toolbar.
* Choose **View > Show (or Hide) Layers** from the View menu at the top of your screen.
* Press `Option ⌥` + `L` on your keyboard.

***

## Tab bar

The Tab bar lets you easily switch between documents if you have more than one open at a time.

Pixelmator Pro opens documents in tabs by default but if you'd like to have a document in a separate window, you can drag any tab from the Tab bar to detach it.

Also, if you'd like to see the previews of the documents in tabs, choose **Window > Show Tab Overview** from the Window menu at the top of your screen.

:bulb: **Tip:** You can create new empty images or open pre-designed templates and mockups from the Tab bar. Click Add new tab <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Plus.png" alt="" data-size="line"> on the right of the Tab bar to do so.

#### Show or hide the Tab bar:

* Choose **Window > Show (or Hide) Tab Bar** from the Window menu at the top of your screen.

***

## Image canvas

The front and center of the Pixelmator Pro window is the image canvas. It’s your main working area and a place where any photos, shapes or text you add will appear.

You can zoom in and out of the canvas, pan it in any direction while zoomed in, and scroll beyond the edges of the canvas.

If you’re mainly working with projects created from scratch, you can choose whether you want to start every new document with a white, black, or transparent image canvas. Go to [Pixelmator Pro settings](pixelmator-pro-settings/) to choose the background type you want.

:blue\_book: **Note:** In Pixelmator Pro, you can hide all the elements of the interface except the image canvas. Choose **View > Hide Interface** from the View menu at the top of your screen or press `Control ⌃` + `H` on your keyboard to do so.

***

## Rulers

Rulers help to accurately arrange and size layers on the canvas. When rulers are turned on, they appear at the top and the left side of the document window. Special markers on both rulers indicate your pointer’s exact position as you move it along the working area.

Rulers almost always come hand in hand with guides — another great tool to help arrange objects on a canvas more precisely. Add guides by clicking and dragging the arrow from the ruler onto the canvas.

:blue\_book: **Note:** Rulers in new documents will be turned on automatically if a document before it had Rulers activated.

For more information about guides and rulers, see [Use rulers](../working-with-layers/use-rulers.md) and [Use alignment guides](../working-with-layers/use-alignment-guides.md).

{% embed url="https://d2hh90bli6ucxp.cloudfront.net/help/basics/rulers-2.4.mp4" %}

#### Show or hide Rulers

Do one of the following:

* Choose **View > Show (or Hide) Rulers** from the View menu at the top of your screen.
* Click the disclosure arrow next to the Show or Hide the Layers sidebar <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Panel.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button in the toolbar, then choose Show (or Hide) Rulers.
* Press `Command ⌘` + `R` on your keyboard.

***

## Overlays

Overlays are non-printing elements such as the grid, layer handles, or active selections that show up on an image but are not part of it themselves.

#### Show or hide all overlays

Do one of the following:

* Choose **View > Hide Overlay** or **View > Show Overlay** from the View menu at the top of your screen.
* Press `Command ⌘` + `Shift ⇧` + `H` on your keyboard.

#### Show or hide specific overlays

Do one of the following:

1. Choose **View > Overlays**.
2. In the Overlays submenu, select or deselect one of the following:
   * _Guides_: Shows or hides persistent guides on the canvas.
   * _Grid_: Shows or hides a custom grid.
   * _Pixel Grid_: Shows or hides a pixel grid on the canvas (visible when zoomed in close on an image).
   * _Shape Outline_: Shows or hides outlines of shapes (useful when working with combined shapes).
   * _Layer and Selection Handles_: Shows or hides square white selection handles around layers when they are selected.
   * _Quick Canvas Controls_: Shows or hides media placeholder or alternative element group buttons on the canvas.

:bulb: **Tip:** To enable shape outlines, you can also `Control ⌃` – click any shape on the canvas and choose Show Shape Outline from the menu that appears.

***

## Info bar

The Info bar provides useful information about the image or a selected layer. That includes properties such as the RGB color values (1), cursor position (2), layer dimensions (3), position change (4), starting position (5), angle (6), color profile (7), color depth (8), and image dimensions (9).

![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1605448653000.png)

:bulb: **Tip:** You can `Control ⌃` – click the Info bar to add or remove certain properties.

The Info bar also offers quick access to Image Size, Color Profile, and Color Depth settings. Double-click the desired setting in the Info bar to open a dedicated edit sheet.
