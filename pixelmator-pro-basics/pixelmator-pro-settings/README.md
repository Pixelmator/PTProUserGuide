# Pixelmator Pro settings

Using Pixelmator Pro settings, you can change how Pixelmator Pro looks and behaves. These settings will apply to all your documents.

Some settings are part of your computer’s System Settings, rather than Pixelmator Pro settings. For example, you should set the language settings in the Language & Region section of System Settings. To open System Settings, click the Apple menu in the top-left corner of your screen, then choose System Settings.
