# Workspace settings

The workspace settings let you change the arrangement of Pixelmator Pro interface elements such as the Tool Options pane, Layers, and the Tools sidebars. You can choose from the available workspace presets for editing photos, drawing illustrations, or painting. The set of tools also changes based on the workspace type selected. For instance, the "Painting" workspace will focus more on the tools for creating digital or traditional paintings such as brush tools, fill tools, or erasers.

To open Workspace settings:

* Choose **Pixelmator Pro > Settings** from the menu bar and choose Workspace.

## Choose a workspace layout

In the Workspace settings tab, click any of the workspace presets. You can choose from workspaces built for photography, design, illustration, and more. Once you select a preset, Pixelmator Pro automatically rearranges tools, sidebars, and other interface elements to best suit a particular workflow.

If you can't find an arrangement you like, you can also click **Customize Layout** to rearrange the workspace elements manually to find what works best for your particular workflow.

You can also create custom workspace layouts by adding them as additional workspace presets.

## Rearrange your workspace

The Pixelmator Pro workspace is freely customizable — you can change the arrangement of different interface elements such as the Layers sidebar, Tool Options pane, and Tools sidebar to find a layout that best suits your editing style.

In the layout customization window, drag any of the highlighted elements to start rearranging the workspace. If you simply click and hold an element, special indicators will appear suggesting where you can move it.

For instance, the Tools sidebar will snap to any edge of the application window, while the Tool Options pane and the Layers sidebar can be placed on the left or the right side of the screen.

To remove, reset, or rename a workspace preset, `Control ⌃` – click the preset thumbnail and choose an option.
