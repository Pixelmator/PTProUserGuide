# Workspace settings

The workspace settings let you change the arrangement of Pixelmator Pro interface elements such as the Tool Options pane, Layers, and the Tools sidebars. You can choose from the available workspace presets for editing photos, drawing illustrations, or painting. The set of tools also changes based on the workspace type selected. For instance, the "Painting" workspace will focus more on the tools for creating digital or traditional paintings such as brush tools, fill tools, or erasers.

To open Workspace settings:

* Choose **Pixelmator Pro > Settings** from the menu bar and choose Workspace.

## Choose a Pixelmator Pro workspace layout

In the Workspace settings tab, click any of the workspace presets. You can choose from workspaces built for photography, design, illustration, and more. Once you select a preset, Pixelmator Pro automatically rearranges tools, sidebars, and other interface elements.

If you can't find an arrangement you like, you can also choose Customize Layout to rearrange the workspace elements manually to find what works best for your particular workflow. You can also save your custom layout as preset.

To remove, reset, or rename a workspace preset, `Control ⌃` – click the preset thumbnail and choose an option.

To additionally customize the Tools sidebar or revert to the default set of Pixelmator Pro tools, `Control ⌃` – click the preset thumbnail and choose Customize Tools.
