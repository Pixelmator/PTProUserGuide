# Use the Touch Bar with Pixelmator Pro

If your Mac has a Touch Bar, you can use familiar gestures — such as tap, swipe, and slide — directly on the Touch Bar to edit and control tools and features in Pixelmator Pro. Controls on the Touch Bar change depending on what's selected in the document.

Using the Touch Bar, you can easily select any tool in Pixelmator Pro.

Some of the Pixelmator Pro tools are grouped with other tools. The grouped tools slide out as you tap the primary tool.

When arranging layers, the Arrange tool options in the Touch Bar let you quickly rotate, scale layers, or move them up or down the [layers list](../work-with-layers/).

If a shape is selected, the Touch Bar shows controls to change the shape's [blend mode](../customize-layers-using-styles/change-the-blend-mode-of-a-layer.md), opacity, and apply style presets.
