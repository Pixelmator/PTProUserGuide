# Use text field math

The text fields in Pixelmator Pro are designed in a way that lets you automatically change the numeric values (both whole and decimal) by performing different arithmetic operations. These operations include addition (e.g.: 2+2), subtraction (e.g.: 2-2), multiplication (e.g.: 2\*2), and division (e.g.: 2/2).

Also, if you're making some more advanced calculations, you can use parentheses to define the order of operations (e.g.: (2 px + 2) \* (2 + 2)).
