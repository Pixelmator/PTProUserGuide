# Undo or redo changes

You can undo recent changes and then redo them if you want them back.

* _Undo the last action:_ Choose **Edit > Undo** (from the Edit menu at the top of your screen), or press `Command ⌘` + `Z` on your keyboard.
* _Redo the last action you undid:_ Choose **Edit > Redo** (from the Edit menu at the top of your screen), or press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `Z` on your keyboard.

You can also [view and restore past versions of your documents](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/view-and-restore-past-versions-of-documents-mh40710/mac) if you want to delete all the changes you made since you opened a document or revert to some specific version.
