# Customize the Tools sidebar

The Tools sidebar in Pixelmator Pro is fully customizable. You can add, remove, group, or arrange tools in the Tools sidebar for specific editing purposes. For instance, if you're mainly using Pixelmator Pro to draw illustrations, you can remove retouching, selection, repair, and any other tools that you don't typically use when working with vector shapes.

## Customize the Tools sidebar

1. Open the Tools customization window by doing one of the following:
   * Click More <img src="../.gitbook/assets/More.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the bottom of the Tools sidebar and choose Customize Tools.
   * Choose **Window > Customize Tools** from the Window menu at the top of your screen.
   * `Control ⌃` – click the Pixelmator Pro toolbar and choose Customize Tools.
2. Do any of the following:
   * _Rearrange items in the tools sidebar_: Drag a tool or a group of tools to reorder.
   * _Group tools or remove tools from a group_: Drag a tool over another tool in the list of tools to group them. Click the tool group in the list of tools at the top, and click Remove <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Remove.png" alt="" data-size="line"> next to the tool you want to remove from the group.
   * _Add or remove tools from the Tools sidebar_: Drag a tool to the list of tools at the top to add it. Drag a tool away from the list of tools to remove it.

3. Click Done to confirm the changes.

If you'd like to discard all the changes made to the last opened toolset, click Reset at the bottom of the Tools customization window.

To revert to the original Pixelmator Pro toolset, click Revert to Default Set.
