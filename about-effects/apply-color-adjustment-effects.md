# Apply color adjustment effects

The Color Adjustments category features effects that let you change the colors, light, and contrast of an image or add special effects.

***

### Adjust the colors of an image

Color Adjustments effects can be applied directly to a single layer or, using an effects layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

To adjust colors of the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

* Choose **Format > Effects > Color Adjustments** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen) and choose the sharpen effect you want.
* Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1590058938000.png) in the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), then click Add Effect and add the Color Adjustments effect you want.
* Press F on your keyboard, click Add Effect and add the Color Adjustments effect you want.

To adjust colors of multiple layers in a composition using an [effects layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/861) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Effects** (from the Insert menu at the top of your screen), click Add Effect in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary) and add the Color Adjustments effect you want.
* Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png) at the top of the [Layers sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), choose Effects, click Add Effect in the Tool Options pane and add the Color Adjustments effect you want.
* Press Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + F on your keyboard, click Add Effect in the Tool Options pane and add the Color Adjustments effect you want.

Apply a Color Controls effect

The Color Controls effect lets you adjust the saturation, brightness, and contrast of your selected layer.

Customize the effect:

* Move the _Saturation_ slider to the right to make colors more intense, or to the left to reduce their intensity. You can also enter a value from 0% to 200%. Moving the slider all the way to the left (or entering 0%) will remove all color, turning the image black and white.
* Move the _Brightness_ slider to the right to make colors lighter or to the left to make them darker. You can also enter a value from -100% to 100%.
* Move the _Contrast_ slider to the right to increase contrast or to the left to decrease it. You can also enter a value from 20% to 400%.
