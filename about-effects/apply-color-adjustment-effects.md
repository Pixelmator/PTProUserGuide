# Apply color adjustment effects

The Color Adjustments category features effects that let you change the colors, light, and contrast of an image or add special effects.

## Adjust the colors of an image

Color Adjustments effects can be applied directly to a single layer or, using an effects layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

1. Select the layer or layers you want to edit.
2.  Do any of the following:\
    \
    Apply effects to a currently selected layer:

    * Click Effects <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1590058938000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar, then click Add Effect and select an effect from the Color Adjustments collection.
    * Choose **Format > Effects > Color Adjustments** and choose an effect.
    * Press `F` on your keyboard, click Add Effect, and select an effect from the Color Adjustments collection.

    Apply effects to multiple layers:

    * Choose **Insert > Effects** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen, click Add Effect, and select an effect from the Color Adjustments collection.
    * Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar, choose Effects, click Add Effect, and select an effect from the Color Adjustments collection.
    * Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `F` on your keyboard, click Add Effect, and select an effect from the Color Adjustments collection.

### Color Controls effect

The Color Controls effect lets you adjust the saturation, brightness, and contrast of your selected layer.

Customize the effect:

* Move the _Saturation_ slider to the right to make colors more intense, or to the left to reduce their intensity. You can also enter a value from 0% to 200%. Moving the slider all the way to the left (or entering 0%) will remove all color, turning the image black and white.
* Move the _Brightness_ slider to the right to make colors lighter or to the left to make them darker. You can also enter a value from -100% to 100%.
* Move the _Contrast_ slider to the right to increase contrast or to the left to decrease it. You can also enter a value from 20% to 400%.

### Apply an Exposure Adjust effect

The Exposure Adjust effect works in a similar way to changing the exposure settings of a digital camera — it makes the entire image (the shadows, midtones, and highlights together) brighter or darker.

* Move the EV slider to the right to make the entire image brighter or to the left to make it darker. You can also enter a value from -1000% to 1000%.
