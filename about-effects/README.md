# Add effects

Using effects, you can completely change the look of images, shapes, and text in a range of different ways. All Pixelmator Pro effects are available from the Effects Browser where you can search for the effects by name or browse the categories that place similar or related effects together, such as Blur, Tile, and Stylize. The Blur category, for example, includes the Gaussian, Box, Disc, Motion, Zoom, Spin, Bokeh, Tilt-Shift, and Focus blur effects.

You can apply effects to individual layers or, if you'd like them to affect the entire composition, as effects layers. In both cases, the effects are completely nondestructive, and can be edited or removed at any time. Because the effects in Pixelmator Pro are nondestructive, you can apply any number of them to your graphic, combining them to develop artistic or special effects of your own. And the presets feature lets you save effect combinations, reuse them in any of your images, and even share them with other Pixelmator Pro users.
