# Apply fill effects

The effects in the Fill category fill your selected layer using a color, gradient, pattern, or image.

***

## Fill an image with color, gradient, pattern, or image

Fill effects can be applied directly to a single layer or, using an effects layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

1. Select the layer or layers you want to edit.
2.  Do any of the following:\
    \
    Apply effects to a currently selected layer:

    * Click Effects <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1590058938000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar, then click Add Effect and select an effect from the Fill collection.
    * Choose **Format > Effects > Fill** and choose an effect.
    * Press `F` on your keyboard, click Add Effect, and select an effect from the Fill collection.

    Apply effects to multiple layers:

    * Choose **Insert > Effects** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen, click Add Effect, and select an effect from the Fill collection.
    * Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar, choose Effects, click Add Effect, and select an effect from the Fill collection.
    * Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `F` on your keyboard, click Add Effect, and select an effect from the Fill collection.

### Fill with a solid color

The Color effect fills your selected layer with a custom color.

Customize the effect:

* Click the _Color_ color well to choose which color to fill with. You can also press and hold the Option ⌥ key on your keyboard to quickly pick a color from the image.
* Move the _Opacity_ slider to adjust the transparency of the fill effect.
* Click the _Opacity (Normal)_ pop-up menu to choose a different blend mode.

To preserve layer transparency when filling a layer with a solid color, click the effect name in the Tool Options pane and choose Preserve Transparency.

### Fill with a gradual transition between colors

The Gradient effect fills your selected layer with a gradual transition between multiple colors.

Customize the effect:

* Click the _Gradient_ well to customize the gradient or choose a new one using the [gradients palette](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1231).
* Move the _Scale_ slider to adjust the transition between the colors of the gradient. You can also enter a value from 0% to 200%.
* Move the _Angle_ wheel to adjust the rotation of the gradient. You can also enter a value from 0.0º to 359.9º.  Move the _Opacity_ slider to adjust the transparency of the gradient. Click the _Opacity (Normal)_ pop-up menu to choose a different blend mode.
* Move the handles of the effect rope to adjust the position of the gradient. If the effect rope isn’t visible, click the rope button in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).

To preserve layer transparency when filling a layer with a transition between two colors, click the effect name in the Tool Options pane and choose Preserve Transparency.

### Fill a layer with a repeating pattern

The Pattern effect fills your selected layer with a repeating pattern.

Customize the effect:

* Drag and drop the image you’d like to use as the pattern onto the image well in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary). Or click the _Image_ pop-up menu, click Choose, find the image you’d like to use and click Import.

* Move the handles of the effect rope to adjust the position of the pattern. If the effect rope isn’t visible, click the rope button in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).

### Fill a layer with a custom image

The Image effect fills your selected layer with a custom image, similar to the way a clipping mask clips the contents of one layer to the outline of another.

Customize the effect:

* Drag and drop the image you’d like to use as the fill image onto the image well in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary). Or click the Image pop-up menu, click Choose, find the image you’d like to use, and click Import.

* Move the _Angle_ wheel to adjust the rotation of the image. You can also enter a value from 0.0º to 359.9º. 
* Move the _Opacity_ slider to adjust the transparency of the image. Click the _Opacity (Normal)_ pop-up menu to choose a different blend mode.
