# Apply blur effects

Pixelmator Pro includes 9 different blur effects: Gaussian, Box, Disc, Motion, Zoom, Spin, Bokeh, Tilt-Shift, and Focus — each of these blurs layers in a different way.

***

### Add a blur to an image

Blur effects can be applied directly to a single layer or, using an effects layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

To edit the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

* Choose **Format > Effects > Blur** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen) and choose a type of blur you want to add.
* Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1590058938000.png) in the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), then click Add Effect and add the Blur effect you want.
* Press F on your keyboard, click Add Effect and add the Blur effect you want.

To edit multiple layers in a composition using an [effects layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/861) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Effects** (from the Insert menu at the top of your screen), click Add Effect in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary) and add the Blur effect you want.
* Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png) at the top of the [Layers sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), choose Effects, click Add Effect in the Tool Options pane and add the Blur effect you want.
* Press Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + F on your keyboard, click Add Effect in the Tool Options pane and add the Blur effect you want.

Apply a Gaussian blur

The Gaussian blur effect adds a smooth, even blur to your entire image, text, or shape layer.

* Drag the Radius slider to the right to make the Gaussian blur effect stronger, or to the left to reduce it. Hold down the Option ⌥ key to extend the range of the Radius slider. You can also enter a value from 0.0 px to 400.0 px.
