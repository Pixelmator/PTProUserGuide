### Sharpen an image

Sharpen effects can be applied directly to a single layer or, using an effects layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

To sharpen the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

* Choose **Format > Effects > Sharpen** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen) and choose the sharpen effect you want.
* Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1590058938000.png) in the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), then click Add Effect and add the Sharpen effect you want.
* Press F on your keyboard, click Add Effect and add the Sharpen effect you want.

To sharpen multiple layers in a composition using an [effects layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/861) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

Apply a Sharpen effect

The Sharpen effect improves image detail and clarity by increasing the contrast near any edges in the image.

* Drag the Radius slider to the right to increase the strength of the sharpening effect, or to the left to decrease it. You can also enter a value from 0.0 px to 100.0 px.
* Drag the Intensity slider to the right to increase the contrast near any edge, or to the left to decrease it. You can also enter a value from 0% to 100%.
