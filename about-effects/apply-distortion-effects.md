# Apply distortion effects

The Distortion category features the Bump, Pinch, Twirl, Circle Splash, Displacement Map, Hole, Light Tunnel, and Vortex effects — these effects physically distort your selected layer.

Distortion effects can be applied directly to a single layer or, using an effects layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

1. Select the layer or layers you want to edit.
2.  Do any of the following:\
