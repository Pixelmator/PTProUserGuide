# Apply distortion effects

The Distortion category features the Bump, Pinch, Twirl, Circle Splash, Displacement Map, Hole, Light Tunnel, and Vortex effects — these effects physically distort your selected layer.

***

### Distort an image

Distortion effects can be applied directly to a single layer or, using an effects layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

To distort the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

* Choose **Format > Effects > Distortion** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen) and choose the distortion effect you want.
* Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1590058938000.png) in the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), then click Add Effect and add the Distortion effect you want.
* Press F on your keyboard, click Add Effect and add the Distortion effect you want.

To distort multiple layers in a composition using an [effects layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/861) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Effects** (from the Insert menu at the top of your screen), click Add Effect in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary) and add the Distortion effect you want.
