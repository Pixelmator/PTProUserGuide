The High Pass effect can be considered the opposite of the Gaussian blur effect.

The High Pass effect is often used for portrait retouching and combined together with the Overlay blend mode.

* Press Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + F on your keyboard, click Add Effect in the Tool Options pane and add the High Pass effect.

* Click the Blend Mode pop-up menu — the words "Opacity (Normal)" — and choose a blend mode.

&#x20;**Tip:** The High Pass effect is often used in combination with [contrast blend modes](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/905) (such as Overlay, Hard Light, etc.) to create different image sharpening effects.
