# Transform layers

The Transform tool in Pixelmator Pro lets you easily transform images, text, shapes or layer masks. Not only you can use it to resize, position, and rotate layers as you normally would using the [Arrange tool](use-the-arrange-tool.md), but also manipulate them in a number of different ways. You can slant the objects on your canvas vertically or horizontally, stretch their corners to any direction you want, or change their perspective.

***

## Choose the Transform tool

1. Select a layer you'd like to transform.
2. Do any of the following:
   1. Choose the Arrange <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1590505056000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool, then click Transform at the bottom of the tool options pane.
   2. Choose **Edit > Transform** from the Edit menu at the top of your screen.
   3. Press `Command ⌘` + `T` on your keyboard.&#x20;

<summary>Freely transform a layer</summary>

1. At the top of the Transform tool options, select the Resize mode.
2. To choose whether to resize a layer freely or proportionally select or deselect "Constrain proportions" in the Tool Options pane. \
   Alternatively, you can press and hold the `Shift ⇧` key while resizing.
3. Once the Transform tool is turned on, you'll notice black layer handles appear around the selected layer on the canvas. Drag one of the handles to start transforming the layer:
   * _Scale by dragging._ Drag the handles of the transform bounding box outward to scale the layer up, or inward to scale it down.
   * _Rotate by dragging._ Move the pointer outside the transform bounding box until the pointer changes to an angle pointer with arrows then drag to rotate the object. You can also rotate using the Rotation wheel in the Tool Options pane.
4. To finish transforming and apply your changes, click Apply at the bottom of the Tool Options pane.

You can use different units, such as centimeters, millimeters, inches, pixels, or percent. `Control ⌃` – click the value field and choose a unit from the shortcut menu that appears.

<summary>Transform layer perspective</summary>

1. Select a layer to transform.
2. Choose **Edit > Transform** from the Edit menu at the top of your screen or press `Command ⌘` + `T` on your keyboard.&#x20;
3. In the Tool Options pane, select the Perspective transform mode. You can also press and hold `Option ⌥` + `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` on your keyboard to temporarily activate the Perspective mode.&#x20;
4. Drag the corner handles to change the perspective vertically or horizontally. Dragging handles at the sides of the layer slants it vertically or horizontally.
5. To finish transforming and apply your changes, click Apply at the bottom of the Tool Options pane.

**Important:** Changing the perspective of text layers converts them into shape, so you can no longer change their font, typeface, or alignment. To transform a text layer and keep it formattable, you can use the nondestructive [Perspective Transform](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1121) effect.
