# Convert layers into pixels

In Pixelmator Pro, you can work with raster and vector layers. The main difference between the two is that the primary building blocks of raster layers are pixels, while vector graphics are made up of paths.

You can change the type of vector layer by converting it to pixels, in other words, _rasterizing_ it.

***

### Convert a layer into pixels

Do one of the following:

* In the Layers sidebar, `Control ⌃` – click a layer and choose Convert into Pixels.
* Select a layer, then choose **Format > Convert into Pixels** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.

:bulb: **Tip:** You can also rasterize regular image layers to merge any color adjustments, effects, or styles applied to them.
