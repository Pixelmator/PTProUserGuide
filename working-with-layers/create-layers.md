# Create layers

In Pixelmator Pro, you can create different kinds of layers in a variety of ways. For example, you can create new, empty layers, add images or photos stored on your Mac as layers, create layers from selections, add text, shapes, adjustment layers, and more.

Below, you'll learn all the different ways you can add layers to your projects. You don't necessarily have to remember them all — just pick one that best suits your workflow.

## Create a new empty layer

Do one of the following:

* Click Add <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Add.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar.
* Choose **Insert > Empty Layer** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen.
* Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `N` on your keyboard.

New empty layers are completely transparent and have no content yet. This means they don't show up on the canvas and can only be selected from the Layers sidebar. If you don't see the Layers sidebar, choose **View > Show Layers** from the View menu at the top of your screen.

## Add image, shape, text, effect, and color adjustment layers

1. Click Add <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar or open the Insert menu in the menu bar at the top of your screen.
2. Choose any of the following:
   * _Insert layer._ Create a new empty layer.
   * _Color Adjustments._ Create a new color adjustments layer.
   * _Effects._ Create a new effects layer.
   * _Text._ Create a new text layer. To edit and customize the text, choose **Tools > Type** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen or press the `T` key, then click the text layer you’ve added.
   * _Circular Text._ Create a new text layer or a circular path.
   * _Shape._ Select one of the basic shapes or draw shapes using the [Pen tool](../draw-shapes-and-vector-graphics/draw-shapes-with-the-pen-tool.md).
   * _Custom Shape._ Open the Shapes browser and choose a shape.
   * _Photos or Videos._ Add an image or video from Photos as a layer.
   * _Facetime._ Capture an image with the FaceTime camera to add as a layer.
   * _Choose from Finder._ Add an image or video saved on your Mac as a layer. You can import videos, images, multilayered PXD, PXM, PSD documents, SVGs, and more.

## Create a new layer from a selection

1. Make a selection.
2. Do one of the following:
   * Choose **Edit > Copy**, then **Edit > Paste** from the Edit menu at the top of your screen.
   * `Control ⌃` – click the selection and choose Copy and Paste as Layer.

Once you copy the selection, you can deselect it by pressing Command ⌘ + D on your keyboard or continue working within the boundaries of the selection.

## Capture an image with iPhone or iPad camera to add as a layer

The Continuity Camera lets you insert the photos you capture on your iPhone or iPad directly into Pixelmator Pro.

To insert a photo:

1. Choose **Insert > Import from iPhone or iPad** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen, and click Take Photo.
2. Use your device's camera to take a photo and tap Use Photo. To retake a photo, tap Retake.

:blue\_book: **Note:** If the Take Photo option is grayed out, make sure you’re signed in to your iPhone, iPad, and Mac with the same Apple ID. Also, check if both your devices have Bluetooth and network connections turned on.
