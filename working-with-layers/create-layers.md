# Create layers

In Pixelmator Pro, you can create different kinds of layers in a variety of ways. For example, you can create new, completely empty layers, add images or photos stored on your Mac as layers, create layers from selections, add text, shapes, adjustment layers, and more.

Below, you'll learn all the different ways you can add layers to your projects. You don't necessarily have to remember them all — just pick one that best suits your workflow.

## Create a new empty layer

Do one of the following:

* Click Add <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1604676890000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar.
* Choose **Insert > Empty Layer** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen.
* Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `N` on your keyboard.

New empty layers are completely transparent and have no content yet. This means they don't show up on the canvas and can only be selected from the Layers sidebar. If you don't see the Layers sidebar, choose **View > Show Layers** (from the View menu at the top of your screen).

## Create a new shape layer

Do one of the following:

* Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the [Layers sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), choose Shape and select one of the basic shapes or draw using the [Pen tool](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/776).
* Choose **Insert > Shape** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen and select one of the options.

**Tip:** If a photo you add happens to be larger than the canvas, some of its content may be hidden beyond the edges of the canvas. [Zoom out](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1279) of the image until you see the layer handles, then resize it to fit the canvas. If you don't mind changing the canvas size, you can also choose **Image > Reveal Canvas** (from the Image menu at the top of your screen) to show the entire image.
