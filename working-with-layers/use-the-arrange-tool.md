# Use the Arrange tool

The Arrange tool lets you select, move, resize, and rotate the shapes, images, and text you add to the canvas. You can also use it to align, change the shape or perspective of layers to fit them nicely into your designs, and do a whole lot more.

With the Arrange tool you can:

* [_Select layers_](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/662). To start editing any layer, you first need to select it. Use the Arrange tool to select one or multiple layers at a time directly on the canvas.
* [_Move and align layers_](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/984). Position elements at a specific place on the canvas. You can move and align one or multiple layers at a time, enter the exact coordinates where to place a layer, and more.
* [_Resize, rotate, and flip layers_](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/991). Make layers bigger or scale them down, rotate, or mirror layers by flipping vertically or horizontally.
* [_Transform layers_](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1166). Freely transform text, image, or shape layers to adjust perspective, skew, stretch layers in any direction, or resize using special scaling algorithms.
