# Add curved or circular text

Use the Circular Type tool to add curved or circular text.

1. Press `Option ⌥` + `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `T` on your keyboard or choose the Circular Type tool by doing one of the following:
   * Choose the Circular Type <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1593759714000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar or choose it from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Type > Circular Type** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
2. Draw on the canvas to create a circular path.

3. To begin typing, double-click within the text box to highlight the placeholder text or place the insertion point where you want the first character to appear.

Once you've added text, you can `Shift ⇧`-drag one of the text box handles to move the text box along the path or `Option ⌥`-drag to expand the text box and make room for more text. Also, if there’s too much text to display in the shape, a clipping indicator appears. Drag this handle until all the text is showing.

:bulb: **Tip:** To additionally transform the text path or to flip text along the path `Control ⌃` – click the path and choose an option.

You can change the look of text just like any other text in your document.
