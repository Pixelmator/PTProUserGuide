# Change text capitalization

You can set Pixelmator Pro to automatically capitalize words at the beginning of sentences. You can also quickly make selected text all uppercase or lowercase, or format text as a title, with the first letter of each word capitalized.

1. Choose the Type tool by doing one of the following:
   * Choose the Type <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580998705000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Tools > Type** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `T` key on your keyboard.
2.  In the Tool Options pane select the text you want to capitalizeâ€¨.

    To change all of the text in a text box, select the text box.
3. Choose **Format > Font > Capitalization** from the Format menu at the top of the screen and select an option.
