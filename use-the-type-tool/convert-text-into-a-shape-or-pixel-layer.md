# Convert text into a shape or pixel layer

Converting text into a shape turns it into a vector layer, so you can edit it and customize it just like any other vector shape by adjusting points, direction handles, or combining it with other shapes. Converting it into a pixel layer lets you use the pixel-based tools, for example, the [Eraser](../paint-and-erase/), to erase parts of it.

1. [Select](../work-with-layers/select-layers.md) the text layer you’d like to convert.
2. To convert the text into a shape layer, do one of the following:
   * Choose **Format > Convert into Shape** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
   * Select the Type tool and click the Convert into Shape button at the bottom of the Tool Options pane.
   * In the Layers sidebar, `Control ⌃` – click the text layer and choose Convert into Shape.
3. To convert the text into a pixel layer, do one of the following:
   * Choose **Format > Convert into Pixels** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
   * Select the Type tool and click the Convert into Pixels button at the bottom of the Tool Options pane.
   * In the Layers sidebar, `Control ⌃` – click the text layer and choose Convert into Pixels.
