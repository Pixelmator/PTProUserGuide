# Use dictation to enter text

With keyboard dictation, you can dictate text anywhere you can type it. A feedback window gauges your speaking volume and provides basic dictation controls.

1. Place the insertion point where you want to begin dictating or select the text you want to replace. 
2.  Choose **Edit > Start Dictation** from the Edit menu at the top of your screen.

    If you haven’t used dictation before, follow the guided setup instructions that appear. &#x20;

    :bulb: **Tip:** When dictation is set up, you can also press the Function `Fn` key on your keyboard twice to start dictation.
3.  When the microphone appears, begin speaking.

    To add punctuation, speak its name (for example, _comma_ or _apostrophe_).
4. Click Done below the microphone when you’re finished.
