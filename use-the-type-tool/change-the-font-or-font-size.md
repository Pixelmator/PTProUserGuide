## Replace fonts

If you see a "This document has missing fonts" message upon opening a file in Pixelmator Pro, this means that the file uses fonts that are currently not installed on your Mac. If missing fonts are not resolved, the default font is used to replace them. Note that this can affect the appearance of the file, so it's recommended to install and replace the default font with the original or a similar font.

In case the "This document has missing fonts" message doesn't show up, you can view what fonts are missing and replace them by doing one of the following:

1. Choose **Format > Font > Replace Fonts** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
2.  Click the double arrows to the right of the font you want to replace, then choose a replacement.

    If the font is listed as a missing font, also choose a typeface.
3.  Click Replace Fonts.

    The font is replaced everywhere it occurs. The replacement font uses the same size and weight as the font it replaces.

If you have the missing font and want to install it on your computer, use the macOS Font Book, available in the Applications folder of your Mac.

If you chose a replacement font for the document, then installed the missing font, your document continues to use the replacement font unless you replace it again with the font you installed.
