# Change the color of text

You can change the color of text to any color you want using the Pixelmator Pro [color picker](../pixelmator-pro-basics/choose-and-manage-colors-in-pixelmator-pro.md) or the macOS Colors window.

1. Choose the Type tool by doing one of the following:
   * Choose the Type <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Type.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Tools > Type** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `T` key on your keyboard.
2.  Select the text you want to change.

    To change all of the text in a text box, select the text box.â€¨
3. Click the color well to choose a color or click <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Color-picker.png" alt="" data-size="line"> to pick a color from the image.

:bulb: **Tip:** You can also drag a color from the color well in the toolbar or any other color well in Pixelmator Pro.

You can also customize the look of text (change the fill color, add stroke, or shadows) using [layer styles](../customize-layers-using-styles/).
