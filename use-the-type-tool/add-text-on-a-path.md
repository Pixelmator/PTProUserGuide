3. To begin typing, double-click within the text box to highlight the placeholder text or place the insertion point where you want the first character to appear.

Once you've added text, you can `Shift ⇧`-drag one of the text box handles to move the text box along the path or `Option ⌥`-drag to expand the text box and make room for more text. Also, if there’s too much text to display in the shape, a clipping indicator appears. Drag this handle until all the text is showing.
