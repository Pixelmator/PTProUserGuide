## Align text vertically

1.  Select a bounded text box.

    :blue\_book: **Note:** To vertically align text, you must add text to a bounded text box, not a free one as free text boxes are automatically resized based on the amount of text inside them. Bounded text boxes have eight layer handles (white squares) indicating they can be resized in any direction. Free text boxes have two layer handles, one on each side of the text box.
