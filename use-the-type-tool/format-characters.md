# Format characters

You can increase or decrease the spacing between characters in any text. You might want to do this, for example, to experiment with line length in text, or to make a title fit on a single line.

Another way to affect character spacing is to use _ligatures_, a decorative joining of two characters to form a single typographic character. You can use ligatures in your image if the font you’re using supports them.

You can turn ligatures on or off from the Action pop-up menu in the Tool Options pane.&#x20;
