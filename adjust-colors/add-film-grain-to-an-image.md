* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Grain** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Tools sidebar, click Color Adjustments <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Color-Adjustments.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and turn on the Grain adjustment.
* Press `A` on your keyboard and turn on the Grain adjustment.

## Apply a film grain multiple layers in a composition

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen and turn on the Grain adjustment in the Tool Options pane.
