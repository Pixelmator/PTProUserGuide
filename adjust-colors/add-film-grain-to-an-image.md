The Grain adjustment emulates the look of analog film. You can use it to add some film grain to digital images.

### Add film grain to an image

1.  You can add film grain to a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

    To apply a film grain to the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

    * Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Grain** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen).
    * In the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png) and turn on the Grain adjustment.
    * Press A on your keyboard and turn on the Grain adjustment.

To apply a film grain multiple layers in a composition using a [color adjustments layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1343) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** (from the Insert menu at the top of your screen) and turn on the Grain adjustment in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).

* Press Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + A on your keyboard, and turn on the Grain adjustment.

_Note:_ If the adjustment isn't visible, you can turn it on from the Customize menu at the bottom of the Color Adjustments pane.

2\. Drag the Size slider to control the size of the grain particles. Press and hold the Option ⌥ key before dragging if you’d like to extend the range of the slider beyond 100%. You can also manually enter a percentage value from 0% to 400%.

3\. Drag the Intensity slider to adjust the visibility of the grain particles. You can also manually enter a value from 0% to 100%.
