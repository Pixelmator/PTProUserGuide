# See what an image looks like on another device

Sometimes, images printed or displayed on other devices look different than the same images displayed on your own screen. To see how the image colors might look after you print them or view them on a different display, you can choose a proofing profile that matches the characteristics of the output device. When soft proofing, Pixelmator Pro changes the screen colors to simulate how the image would look like on a different device or printed.

### Soft proof image colors

1. Open an image in Pixelmator Pro.
2. Turn on soft proofing by doing one of the following:
   * Choose **View > Soft Proof Colors > Enable Soft Proof Colors** (from the View menu at the top of your screen).
   * Press Command ⌘ + Y on the keyboard. _Note:_ Soft proofing only works when the image or graphic has a color profile applied. If color profile is set to None under **Image > Color Profile**, the Soft Proof Colors menu will be grayed out.
3. Choose the color profile you want from the submenu.

_Note:_ If you're not seeing the color profile you want, you may need to install it. This can be done by placing the color profile in the ColorSync Profiles folder of the macOS System library (/Library/ColorSync/Profiles).

To make sure the image looks like it will on the other device, view the image under the same viewing conditions you’d use on the other device.
