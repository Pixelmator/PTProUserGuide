# White balance an image

Sometimes, after shooting a particular scene, you may want to make the entire image warmer (more yellow) or cooler (bluer). Or you might notice that an image looks too warm, too cool, or has a green or magenta tint that you’d like to remove. The White Balance adjustment lets you do just that — you can adjust the white balance manually, or automatically using the machine learning-powered ML adjustment. ML uses computer vision to recognize objects in the image (for example, people, trees, or a sky), and white balances it to remove any unnatural color tints.

* In the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png) and turn on White Balance.
* Press A on your keyboard and turn on the White Balance adjustment.

To white balance multiple layers in a composition using a [color adjustments layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1343) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** (from the Insert menu at the top of your screen) and turn on the White Balance adjustment in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).

2. Drag the Tint slider to the left to add a green tint (or neutralize a magenta tint) or drag the slider to the right to add a magenta tint (or neutralize a green tint). Press and hold the Option ⌥ key before dragging if you’d like to extend the range of the Tint slider beyond 100%. You can also enter a percentage value from –200% to 200%.
