The Invert adjustment inverts all the colors of an image into their opposite colors.

You can invert the colors of a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, multiple layers in a composition.

## Edit the currently selected layer

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Invert** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Tools sidebar, click Color Adjustments <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and turn on the Invert adjustment.
* Press `A` on your keyboard and turn on the Invert adjustment.

## Edit multiple layers in a composition

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen and turn on the Invert adjustment in the Tool Options pane.
* Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar, choose Color Adjustments, and turn on the Invert adjustment.
* Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `A` on your keyboard, and turn on the Invert adjustment.
