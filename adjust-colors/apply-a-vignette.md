# Apply a vignette

The Vignette adjustment gradually darkens or lightens the outer edges of a photo, drawing attention to the center.

***

### Apply a vignette to an image

1.  You can apply a vignette to a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, multiple layers in a composition.

    To apply a vignette to the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

    * Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Vignette** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen).
    * In the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png) and turn on the Vignette adjustment.
    * Press A on your keyboard and turn on the Vignette adjustment.

To apply a vignette to multiple layers in a composition using a [color adjustments layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1343) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** (from the Insert menu at the top of your screen) and turn on the Vignette adjustment in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).
* Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png) at the top of the [Layers sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), choose Color Adjustments, and turn on the Vignette adjustment.
* Press Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + A on your keyboard, and turn on the Vignette adjustment.

_Note:_ If the adjustment isn't visible, you can turn it on from the Customize menu at the bottom of the Color Adjustments pane.

2\. Customize the adjustment:

* Move the _Exposure_ slider to apply an exposure-based vignette to the image. Negative exposure values will brighten the edges of the image and positive ones will make them darker. Press and hold the Option ⌥ key before dragging if you’d like to extend the range of the slider beyond 100%. You can also enter a percentage value from –200% to 200%.
* Move the _Black Point_ slider to apply a black point-based vignette to the image. Negative black point values will brighten the edges of the image and positive ones will make them darker. Press and hold the Option ⌥ key before dragging if you’d like to extend the range of the slider beyond 100%. You can also enter a percentage value from –200% to 200%.
* Move the _Softness_ slider to adjust how gradually the vignette should be applied to the image.

_Show Original:_ Click the Show Original button or press Control ⌃ + M on your keyboard to see what the image looks like without any color adjustments.

_Show Split Comparison:_ Option ⌥ – click the Show Original button, press Control ⌃ + C on your keyboard, or force click the canvas.

To reset all Color Adjustments, click Reset at the bottom of the Color Adjustments pane.
