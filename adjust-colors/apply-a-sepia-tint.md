# Apply a sepia tint

The Sepia adjustment works like the [Color Monochrome adjustment](convert-an-image-to-black-and-white-with-a-color-tint.md), except the sepia color is already selected for you.

A sepia tint can be applied directly to a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

## Apply a sepia tint to the currently selected layer

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Sepia** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Tools sidebar, click Color Adjustments <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and turn on the Sepia adjustment.
* Press `A` on your keyboard and turn on the Sepia adjustment.

## Apply a sepia tint to multiple layers in a composition

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen and turn on the Sepia adjustment in the Tool Options pane.
* Click Insert a layer <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar, choose Color Adjustments, and turn on the Sepia adjustment.
* Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `A` on your keyboard, and turn on the Sepia adjustment.
