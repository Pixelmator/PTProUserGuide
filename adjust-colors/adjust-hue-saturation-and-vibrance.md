# Adjust hue, saturation, and vibrance

The Hue & Saturation adjustment lets you shift all the colors in an image along the color spectrum and increase or decrease their saturation and vibrance. You can also improve the hue & saturation automatically using the machine learning-powered ML adjustment.

***

### Adjust the hue and saturation of an image

You can apply the Hue & Saturation adjustment to a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, multiple layers in a composition.

To edit the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Hue & Saturation** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen).
* In the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png) and turn on Hue & Saturation.
* Press A on your keyboard and turn on the Hue & Saturation adjustment.

To edit multiple layers in a composition using a [color adjustments layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1343) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** (from the Insert menu at the top of your screen) and turn on the Hue & Saturation adjustment in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).

Adjust the vibrance of all the colors in an image

The Vibrance slider targets only the most or least saturated colors depending on whether you’re increasing or decreasing vibrance.

* When increasing vibrance, the intensity of the less saturated areas is increased, while the more saturated areas are less affected.

Press and hold the Option ⌥ key before dragging if you’d like to extend the range of the Vibrance slider beyond 100%. You can also click the Vibrance value and enter a percentage from –200% to 200%.
