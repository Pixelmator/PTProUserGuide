# About color management

In digital image editing, color management refers to a process of ensuring the colors in images or documents are displayed consistently across different screens, devices, or when printed. Color management is handled automatically by Pixelmator Pro, so there isnâ€™t much you need to do for most images you edit. However, at times, you may need to use a specific [color profile](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1025) when editing an image, change the [color depth](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1028), or simulate what an image would look like on another device by [soft proofing](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1190).

Pixelmator Pro currently works in RGB color space. You can convert images to CMYK or grayscale using any profile installed on your Mac when [exporting](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/798).

_Note:_ RAW layers are always displayed and edited using 16-bit color depth, even in 8-bit documents.
