# About color management

In digital image editing, color management refers to a process of ensuring the colors in images or documents are displayed consistently across different screens, devices, or when printed. Color management is handled automatically by Pixelmator Pro, so there isnâ€™t much you need to do for most images you edit. However, at times, you may need to use a specific [color profile](change-the-color-profile-of-an-image.md) when editing an image, change the [color depth](change-the-color-depth-of-an-image.md), or simulate what an image would look like on another device by [soft proofing](see-what-an-image-looks-like-on-another-device.md).

Pixelmator Pro currently works in RGB color space. You can convert images to CMYK or grayscale using any profile installed on your Mac when [exporting](../export-and-share-images/).

:blue\_book: **Note:** RAW layers are always displayed and edited using 16-bit color depth, even in 8-bit documents.
