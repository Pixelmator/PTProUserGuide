# Adjust individual colors in an image

\
Using the Selective Color adjustment, you can adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness of a precise color range in an image without affecting any other colors. The Selective Color adjustment features 8 individual color ranges — reds, oranges, yellows, greens, cyans, blues, violets, and magentas — divided according to the color spectrum. Above each color range, you’ll see a handy histogram that shows you just how much of that particular color is in your image.

***

### Selectively adjust colors in an image

The Selective Color adjustment can be applied directly to a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

To edit the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Selective Color** (from the Format menu at the top of your screen).
* In the [Tools sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png) and turn on the Selective Color adjustment.
* Press A on your keyboard and turn on the Selective Color adjustment.

To edit multiple layers in a composition using a [color adjustments layer](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1343) (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** (from the Insert menu at the top of your screen) and turn on the Selective Color adjustment in the [Tool Options pane](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary).
* Click ![](https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png) at the top of the [Layers sidebar](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/#glossary), choose Color Adjustments, and turn on the Selective Color adjustment.
* Press Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + A on your keyboard, and turn on the Selective Color adjustment.

_Note:_ If the adjustment isn't visible, you can turn it on from the Customize menu at the bottom of the Color Adjustments pane.
