# Adjust individual colors in an image

\
Using the Selective Color adjustment, you can adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness of a precise color range in an image without affecting any other colors. The Selective Color adjustment features 8 individual color ranges — reds, oranges, yellows, greens, cyans, blues, violets, and magentas — divided according to the color spectrum. Above each color range, you’ll see a handy histogram that shows you just how much of that particular color is in your image.

The Selective Color adjustment can be applied directly to a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, to multiple layers in a composition.

## Edit the currently selected layer

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Selective Color** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Tools sidebar, click Color Adjustments <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and turn on the Selective Color adjustment.
* Press `A` on your keyboard and turn on the Selective Color adjustment.

## Edit multiple layers in a composition

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen and turn on the Selective Color adjustment in the Tool Options pane.
* Click Insert a layer <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar, choose Color Adjustments, and turn on the Selective Color adjustment.
* Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `A` on your keyboard, and turn on the Selective Color adjustment.

:blue\_book: **Note:** If the adjustment isn't visible, you can turn it on from the Customize menu at the bottom of the Color Adjustments pane.

2. Drag the sliders in the Selective Color adjustment to make adjustments to your selected color range.
   * _Hue_: Drag the Hue slider to shift the hue of the colors in the selected color range towards a neighboring color range. Press and hold the `Option ⌥` key before dragging if you’d like to extend the range of the Hue slider beyond 100%. You can also enter a percentage value from –400% to 400%.
   * _Saturation_: Drag the Saturation slider to the right to make the colors in the selected color range more intense, or to the left to make them less intense.
   * _Brightness_: Drag the Brightness slider to the right to make the colors in the selected color range brighter, or to the left to make them darker. Press and hold the `Option ⌥` key before dragging if you’d like to extend the range of the Brightness slider beyond 100%. You can also enter a percentage value from –200% to 200%.
