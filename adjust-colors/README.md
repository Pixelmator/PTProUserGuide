# Adjust colors

Color adjustments are used to change the color, lighting, and contrast in images. Pixelmator Pro includes a wide range of adjustments that let you adjust these properties in a variety of different ways. For example, you can change the overall brightness and contrast of an image, make it look warmer or cooler, or adjust specific colors. You can also take advantage of the machine learning-powered tools to fine-tune the colors of an image automatically using [ML Enhance](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1138), or use [Match Colors](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/1171) to match image colors to the colors of any other image.

Each adjustment contains individual parameters, for which you can specify a range of values. Use adjustment controls such as sliders or wheels to change the parameter values.

The color adjustments in Pixelmator Pro can be applied to the layers you're editing directly or as separate color adjustments layers. In both cases, the color adjustments are completely nondestructive, which means the original image and all the settings for the adjustment are always preserved. This lets you adjust and undo those changes whenever you like, even after closing and reopening documents. Pixelmator Pro also includes [presets](https://www.pixelmator.com/support/guide/pixelmator-pro/725) that you can use to easily save any combination of adjustments, reuse them in any of your images, and even share them with others.
