# Automatically match image colors

The machine learning-powered Match Colors feature lets you match colors of one image to the colors of another image. You can match colors of images, clipboard items, selections, shapes, or text to any other images or graphics on your device or the web. The Match Colors algorithm analyzes the source and the target images and then applies a wide range of color adjustments to match their lighting, contrast, and color balance.

You can match colors with single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, with multiple layers in a composition.

## Match colors with the currently selected layer

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Match Colors** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* Click Color Adjustments <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar and choose Match Colors from the More <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1605111967000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> menu at the top of the Color Adjustments pane.
