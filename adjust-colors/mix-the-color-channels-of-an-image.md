# Mix the color channels of an image

Use the Channel Mixer to mix the individual color channels (Red, Green, and Blue) in an image and create intense color effects in your images.

You can mix the color channels of a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, multiple layers in a composition.

## Edit the currently selected layer

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > Channel Mixer** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Tools sidebar, click Color Adjustments <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Color-Adjustments.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and turn on the Channel Mixer adjustment.
* Press `A` on your keyboard and turn on the Channel Mixer adjustment.

## Edit multiple layers in a composition

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen and turn on the Channel Mixer adjustment in the Tool Options pane.
* Click Insert a layer <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Layer.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar, choose Color Adjustments, and turn on the Channel Mixer adjustment.
* Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `A` on your keyboard, and turn on the Channel Mixer adjustment.

:blue\_book: **Note:** If the adjustment isn't visible, you can turn it on from the Customize menu at the bottom of the Color Adjustments pane.

## Customize the Channel Mixer adjustment

To increase one channel's contribution to another, drag a slider to the right; to decrease it, drag it to the left. Press and hold the `Option ⌥` key before dragging if you’d like to extend the range of a slider beyond 100%. You can also enter a percentage value from –200% to 200%.

## Show before and after or reset adjustments

_Show Original:_ Click the Show Original button or press `Control ⌃` + `M` on your keyboard to see what the image looks like without any color adjustments.

_Show Split Comparison:_ `Option ⌥` – click the Show Original button, press `Control ⌃` + `C` on your keyboard, or force-click the canvas.

To reset all Color Adjustments, click Reset at the bottom of the Color Adjustments pane.
