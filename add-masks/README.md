# Mask layers

A layer mask is like an additional sheet you can place over a layer or layer group to hide parts of it. Layer masks are nondestructive because even though the parts they hide are no longer shown, the original layer is fully preserved, and if you turn off or remove the mask, the full layer will reappear. You can also go back to make adjustments to layer masks after adding them.

The quickest way to add a mask is by choosing an option from the special Mask <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1649061178000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> menu at the top of the layers sidebar. Alternatively, you can do any of the following:

## Add a bitmap layer mask

* With the Arrange tool selected, double-click an image layer while holding `Option ⌥.`
* With the Arrange tool selected, double-click a selection while holding `Shift⇧`.
* Choose **Format > Mask > Add Mask** or **Choose Image Mask** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Layers sidebar, `Control ⌃` – click a layer or layer group and choose Add Mask. You can also `Option ⌥` – click Add Mask to add a mask and hide the layer.
* `Command ⌘`-drag any image, text, or image from Finder onto a layer to create a mask.

See [Working with bitmap masks](working-with-bitmap-masks.md) to learn more about editing and refining bitmap masks.

## Add a vector mask

* With the Arrange tool selected, double-click an image layer.
* With the Arrange tool selected, double-click a selection.
* Choose **Format > Mask > Mask with Shape** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Layers sidebar, `Control ⌃` – click a layer, choose Mask with Shape, then select an option.
* `Command ⌘`-drag any shape from the Layers sidebar or directly from any Shape browser in Pixelmator Pro to mask a layer with a shape.
