# Use alignment guides

When moving and sizing layers, smart spacing, and sizing guides automatically appear to help you precisely place and resize layers. They are invisible most of the time and only appear if you move or resize a layer in your image and it becomes a similar size or equidistant to another layer. You can also add persistent alignment guides that are always visible in your image. Certain guides are turned on by default and other, additional guides can be turned on or off in [Pixelmator Pro settings](../pixelmator-pro-basics/pixelmator-pro-settings/).

## **Turn on Smart Guides**

Smart Guides appear when a layer or a layer group matches the size or position of another layer or layer group. Smart Guides can also help equally space three or more objects in a line.

1. Do one of the following:
   * Choose **Pixelmator Pro > Settings** from the Pixelmator Pro menu at the top of your screen, then click the Rulers tab.
   * Choose **View > Smart Guides** from the View menu at the top of your screen.
2. Select any of the options:
   * _Show guides at object center:_ Guides appear when the center of an object aligns with the center of another object or the center of the image.

## Add persistent alignment guides

You can add alignment guides that remain visible on your image while you’re working, even if you close the image and return to it later. You can add as many guides as you like and position them to suit your needs. Alignment guides are unique to each image you edit.&#x20;

To add a guide, do one of the following:

* Click the disclosure arrow next to the Show or hide Layers <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Panel.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button in the Pixelmator Pro toolbar, then choose Show Rulers. Move the pointer over the vertical or horizontal ruler, then click and drag to the image.
* `Control ⌃` – click the vertical or horizontal ruler, and choose Add Guide.
* Double-click a ruler, choose the orientation and position of the ruler, and click OK to add the guide.
* Choose **View > Guides > Add Guide** from the View menu at the top of your screen. Choose the orientation of the guide and type in its position. Click OK to add the guide.

:bulb: **Tip:** If you want, you can change the color of the alignment guides in Pixelmator Pro settings.
