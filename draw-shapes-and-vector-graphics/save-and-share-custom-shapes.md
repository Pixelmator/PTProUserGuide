# Save and share custom shapes

The Shape tool comes with tons of unique shapes you'll find across a number of different shape collections, including Basic, Activities, Food, Objects, Arches, and more. You can also save shapes and shape collections of your own, share the saved shapes with others, or delete the ones you no longer use.

## Save a custom shape

1. Select the Shape tool by doing one of the following:
   * In the Tools sidebar, select the Shape tool <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Shape-Tool.png" alt="" data-size="line">.
   * Press `U` on your keyboard.
2. Do any of the following:
   * In the Layers sidebar, find the shape you'd like to save, then drag its thumbnail to the list of shapes in the Tool Options pane.
   * Select a shape in your image, click More <img src="../.gitbook/assets/More.png" alt="" data-size="line"> next to the Collection pop-up menu, and choose Add Preset.
   * Click Add <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Plus.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in any shape collection to save the custom shape to that collection.

:blue\_book: **Note:** When you save a custom shape, the shape’s size and rotation are saved, but its style properties aren’t.
