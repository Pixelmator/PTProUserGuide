   * In the Tools sidebar, select the Shape tool <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1605106203000.png" alt="" data-size="line">.
   * Press `U` on your keyboard.
2. Do any of the following:
   * In the Layers sidebar, find the shape you'd like to save, then drag its thumbnail to the list of shapes in the Tool Options pane.
