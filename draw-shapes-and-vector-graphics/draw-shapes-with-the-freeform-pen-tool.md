# Draw shapes with the Freeform Pen tool

The Freeform Pen tool is a somewhat simpler and easier to use version of the [Pen tool](draw-shapes-with-the-pen-tool.md) â€” it lets you draw as if with a pencil on paper, adding anchor points and adjusting their direction lines automatically.

1. Choose the Freeform Pen tool by doing any of the following:
   * Click the Freeform Pen <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Pen.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar or choose it from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Draw > Freeform Pen** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `P` key on your keyboard (selects the last used Pen tool).
2. Drag to begin drawing your path.

3. To finish the path and leave it open, release your mouse or trackpad.
4. To finish the path and close it to create a shape, move the path over to its beginning, then stop holding down your mouse or trackpad.

After you draw a vector path, you can further refine, remove, or add anchor points. To learn more about this, see [Edit vector paths](edit-vector-paths.md).
