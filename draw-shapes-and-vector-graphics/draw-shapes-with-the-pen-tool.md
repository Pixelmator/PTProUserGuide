# Draw shapes with the Pen tool

The Pen tool is the classic vector drawing tool — it lets you precisely draw vector shapes and paths by manually adding anchor points, either sharp or smooth. The curved or straight lines that connect the two anchor points are called _vector paths_. Even the most complex of shapes are composed of these paths. In Pixelmator Pro, using the Pen and [Freeform Pen](draw-shapes-with-the-freeform-pen-tool.md) tools, you can draw vector paths to create your own shapes and save them to your shapes library.&#x20;

Smooth anchor points feature additional direction handles. You can move them to adjust how much the path curves at the selected anchor point.&#x20;

A vector path can be closed, which means it has no beginning or end (like a square or circle shape) or it can be open, in which case it is a line with a beginning and end point.

## Draw a straight line segment with the Pen tool

To draw a straight line segment with the Pen tool:

1. Choose the Pen tool by doing any of the following:
   * Click the Pen <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580999700000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar or choose it from the grouped tools.
   * Choose **Tools > Draw > Pen** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `P` key on your keyboard (selects the last used Pen tool).
2. Click (don’t drag) anywhere in your image to begin drawing the line.
3. Click anywhere else in your image to add another anchor point and create a straight-line segment. The last anchor point you added will be solid red, while any points you added previously will be outlined in red.

4. Continue clicking to add additional straight segments to your path.
5. To finish the path and leave it open, do any of the following:
   * Press the `Return ↵` key on your keyboard.
   * Press `Esc` on your keyboard.
   * `Control ⌃` – click the image and choose Finish Drawing.
   * Add the final point by double-clicking instead of single-clicking.
6. To finish the path and close it to create a shape, do any of the following:
   * Press `Shift ⇧` + `Return ↵`
   * Click the first point you added.
   * `Control ⌃` – click the image and choose Close Path.

:bulb: **Tip:** If you’d like to delete the anchor point you last added, press the `Backspace ⌫` key on your keyboard.

After you draw a vector path, you can further refine, remove, or add anchor points. To learn more about this, see [Edit vector paths](edit-vector-paths.md).

## Draw a curved line segment with the Pen tool

1. Choose the Pen tool by doing any of the following:
