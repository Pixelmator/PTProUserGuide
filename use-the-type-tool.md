# Use the Type tool

The Type tool is used to add and customize text in images. The Type tool is grouped with Circular Type, Path Type, and Freeform Type tools that you can use to add curved text, text on a path, or wrap text around a shape. You can also choose from a bunch of [text presets](use-the-type-tool/text-style-presets.md) that come with Pixelmator Pro.

## Create a new text layer

1. Choose the Type tool by doing one of the following:
   * Click the Type <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1580998705000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Tools > Type** from the Tools menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `T` key on your keyboard.
2. Do any of the following:
   * Click anywhere in your image to create a free text box. \
     A free text box has two layer handles (white squares) and automatically resizes based on the amount of text inside it. You can adjust the width of a free text box so any new text will jump onto a new line.

* Drag anywhere in your image to add a bounded text box. \
  A bounded text box has eight layer handles and will not resize to accommodate text. However, bounded text boxes can be resized in any direction and can also have text align to the top, middle, or bottom of the box. If thereâ€™s too much text to display in the shape, a clipping indicator appears. To resize the text box, drag any selection handle until all the text is showing. You can also choose to automatically reduce the size of text when it's too big for its text box or path Shrink text to fit.

3. To begin typing, double-click within the text box to highlight the placeholder text or place the insertion point where you want the first character to appear. The text appears on its own layer. Each time you click to create a text box, a new text layer is added.
4. When you've finished typing, click outside the text box.
