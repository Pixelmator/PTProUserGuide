# Decontaminate colors

When copying and pasting objects from one image to another, or across different projects, you may notice some original background color around the edges of the pasted object. For the object to blend in with the new background more seamlessly, you may want to use the Decontaminate Colors feature and get rid of the residue background color.

***

### Decontaminate the colors of a pasted selection

1. Select the layer you'd like to decontaminate.
2. Choose **Format > Image > Decontaminate Colors** (from the Format menu at the top of the screen).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use Decontaminate Colors often, you can assign a dedicated keyboard shortcut for it in macOS [Settings](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2271/mac) for quick access.
