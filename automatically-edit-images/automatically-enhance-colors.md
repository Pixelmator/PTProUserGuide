# Automatically enhance colors

ML Enhance is an incredibly intelligent and powerful image enhancement feature, trained on millions of professional photos to automatically take care of the most important things that go into a good photo, like the exposure, white balance, black point, and even individual color ranges. It's designed to give you the best starting point for making your own creative edits to a photo.

You can improve the colors of a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, multiple layers in a composition.

Do any of the following:

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > ML Enhance** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Tools sidebar, click Color Adjustments <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Color-Adjustments.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and click ML Enhance.
* Press `A` on your keyboard and click ML Enhance in the Color Adjustments pane.
* Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `M` on your keyboard.

After selecting ML Enhance, you can additionally tweak any of the 37 available color adjustments yourself.
