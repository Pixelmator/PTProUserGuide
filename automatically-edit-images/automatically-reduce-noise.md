# Automatically reduce noise

Use the machine learning-powered Denoise tool to quickly remove camera noise produced by digital cameras. Denoise can also reduce JPEG compression artifacts.

Do any of the following:

* Choose **Format > Denoise** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* Click Color Adjustments <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Color-Adjustments.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar and choose Denoise from the More <img src="../.gitbook/assets/More.png" alt="" data-size="line"> menu.
* Press `A` on your keyboard, then click More <img src="../.gitbook/assets/More.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the very top of the Color Adjustments pane and choose Denoise.
* Press `Control ⌃` + `Shift ⇧` + `D` on your keyboard.
