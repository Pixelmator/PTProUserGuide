# Automatically crop and straighten images

You can crop an image automatically using machine-learning powered Crop. ML Crop uses machine learning to predict the best crop for a selected aspect ratio.

1. Choose the Crop tool by doing one of the following:
   * Click the Crop <img src="../.gitbook/assets/Crop.png" alt="" data-size="line"> tool in the Pixelmator Pro Tools sidebar.
   * Choose **Image > Crop** from the Image menu at the top of your screen.
   * Press the `C` key on your keyboard.
2. Click ML Crop in the Tool Options pane. The button will light up yellow to tell you ML Crop has been used on the image.

With the ML Crop turned on, you can browse through available crop presets for other crop suggestions based on a particular crop aspect ratio.
