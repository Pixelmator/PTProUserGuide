# Enhance colors

ML Enhance is an incredibly intelligent and powerful image enhancement feature, trained on millions of professional photos to automatically take care of the most important things that go into a good photo, like the exposure, white balance, black point, and even individual color ranges. It's designed to give you the best starting point for making your own creative edits to a photo.

## Automatically improve the look of an image

You can improve the colors of a single layer or, using a color adjustments layer, multiple layers in a composition.

To enhance the currently selected layer, do one of the following:

* Choose **Format > Color Adjustments > ML Enhance** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* In the Tools sidebar, click Color Adjustments <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and click ML Enhance.
* Press A on your keyboard and click ML Enhance in the Color Adjustments pane.
* Press `Shift ⇧` + `Command ⌘` + `M` on your keyboard.

To enhance multiple layers in a composition using a color adjustments layer (all layers below this layer will be affected):

* Choose **Insert > Color Adjustments** from the Insert menu at the top of your screen and click ML Enhance in the Color Adjustments pane.
* Click <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1648724547000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the top of the Layers sidebar, choose Color Adjustments, and click ML Enhance.
* Press Shift ⇧ + Command ⌘ + A on your keyboard, and click ML Enhance.

After selecting ML Enhance, you can additionally tweak any of the 37 available color adjustments yourself.

_Show Original:_ Click the Show Original button or press `Control ⌃` + `M` on your keyboard to see what the image looks like without any color adjustments.

_Show Split Comparison:_ `Option ⌥` – click the Show Original button, press `Control ⌃` + `C` on your keyboard, or force-click the canvas.

To reset all Color Adjustments, click Reset at the bottom of the Color Adjustments pane.\
