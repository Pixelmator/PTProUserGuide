# Automatically increase image resolution

Super Resolution is a machine learning-powered scaling algorithm designed to intelligently upscale images while preserving details often lost with traditional scaling methods. Unlike regular algorithms that mathematically interpolate pixel values, Super Resolution analyzes the image's patterns and textures, recreating visually important details in larger dimensions. This allows for impressive results, even when upscaling images to three times their original resolution.

Do any of the following:

* Choose **Format > Super Resolution** from the Format menu at the top of your screen.
* Click Color Adjustments <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1581000192000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the Tools sidebar and choose Super Resolution from the More <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1605111967000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> menu.
* Press `A` on your keyboard, then click More <img src="https://help.pixelmator.com/pixelmator-pro/3.5/assets/English/1605111967000.png" alt="" data-size="line"> at the very top of the Color Adjustments pane and choose Super Resolution.
* Press `Option ⌥` + `Command ⌘` + `U` on your keyboard.
* Choose **Image > Image Size** from the Image menu at the top of your screen to scale an image to a specific size using the Super Resolution algorithm.
